Aer Lingus,3,"""Worst lack of care""","We flew Aer Lingus last summer Seattle to Dublin to Edinburgh and then back Edinburg to Dublin to Seattle. Our plane left quite late from Seattle with no explanation and we ended up getting into Dublin several hours late missing our connecting flight. No one there to help, an hour bouncing around to different Aer Lingus staff in the arrival terminal w/o one person helping us. We finally ended up outside back at check-in in a long line of rebooking passengers who were told we wouldn’t make the next Edinburgh flight as it was booked, last one out that day. The staff were unwilling to book us on Ryan Air which EU regulations say should happen as they had plenty of seats. A supervisor took pity on me and somehow got me on the last flight but we arrived in Edinburgh 5 hours or more late outside of the EU regulations with no food or drink offered or available. Aer Lingus has denied the EU regulation payment saying it’s not covered since  unforeseen circumstances on first rejection and then it was a us domestic originated flight so it isn’t covered (not true since it started in Dublin and arrived late into the States). On flight to Dublin they lost my wife’s suitcase and it didn’t get to us until the 2nd to last day in Ireland, over 72 hours when it’s considered a lost bag, we filed a claim, and not once has anyone acknowledged this reimbursement owed for the modest clothing she had to buy. I’ve been on hold with their customer service for hours, sent many inquiries, and tried to escalate this but no there cares about us.

Aer Lingus,7,"""would certainly use them again""","Our outbound flight was excellent with no issues and on 10 June for our return flight, I have one big issue and some niggles. For the whole flight, the cabin crew locked off one of the two available toilets. There was nothing wrong with it as the cabin and flight crew used it. Keeping a toilet exclusively for crew use is, in my view, unacceptable. The seat on the A330 is comfortable and I had the best 4 hours of continuous sleep I have ever had in the air. The food offering was, for me, poor except for the snack just after take off with the first drink service. It comprised a pack of five mini, savoury biscuits and a little tub of onion chutney to dip, both of which were delicious and very different from the nuts or pretzels others offer. On the outbound flight, we were offered the traditional juice or champagne prior to take off but no attempt was made to offer this on the inbound flight. The Asian-style beef at dinner had little of the Orient about it. I didn't try the dessert or either of the starters. IFE was available but very limited choice compared to many other carriers. Finally the complimentary wi-fi was somehow not available on this leg but you could pay. Outbound no problem a voucher was given shortly after boarding. Okay, quite a bit of whinging there, and apart from the very comfortable seat the only other positive was that despite delayed take off on both legs the plane arrive on time or a little early.

Our flight was due to depart at 8:30 PM and arrive in Dublin at 9:30 AM on the 18th of May. (Aer Lingus Flt. 120).

We were told we would depart at 10;30 then, 11:30. this went on till 2 AM on the 18th. They said the flight was canceled, but we would be boarded in the morning as soon as the aircraft was repaired.

We got to the hotel at 4:30 AM. We had three hours sleep and returned to the airport to see if our plane had been repaired, it hadn't. we were told we would be boarding Aer Lingus flight 34 for Manchester, England at 5:45 PM.

They said that would be another upcharge, which I refused. I requested a refund of the $500 since they didn't deliver what I paid for. They rejected the request.

Aer Lingus,2,"""over 12 hours of delay""","Our flight from Chicago to Dublin was delayed and our connecting flight to Zürich did not wait in Dublin. No big deal, we thought. Usually airlines would route us to the final destination without much fuss. Not the case with aer Lingus. Aer Lingus doesn’t have relationship with most major airlines. So you are presented with very limited choices. Our best case alternative routing presented was over 12 hours of delay from the original time. We even asked for a direct connection the next day but they didn’t have flights to Zürich on Sunday. So the next flight was two days away. We took the alternate route they provided. We were not provided any compensation or voucher.  We had to take the checked bags out at Ireland and go through immigration to get the rebooking done and had to check in afresh again. They provided boarding passes only until Amsterdam and not to the final destination Zürich. The baggage tag was also to Amsterdam. I raised concern over that. The agent said we should collect our bags again at Amsterdam and recheck and collect boarding passes at Amsterdam at KLM counter. The flight to Amsterdam was delayed by two hours. When we reached Amsterdam, we had to go through immigration and collect the bags again. We did that and when we went to check in the bags, we were told that their system doesn’t show that we paid for the bags and we have to pay again. We paid for 30 kg check in bags. Due to Aer Lingus's fault, we now have to pay again for the baggage (55 euro) and an excess baggage fee of 75 euro. Not only that, we had to visit six different counters to get this issue resolved. We spent well over four hours going from counter to counter with kids and bags. Klm staff asked us to pay them and seek reimbursement from aer lingus. When we contacted aer Lingus via them WhatsApp business account, they asked to register a case at their website and provided a link.

Aer Lingus,1,"""our luggage has not been located""","There are lots of choices when booking a flight. We happened to be celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and booked a trip to Italy. The flight itself was fine. We arrived at the airport in Naples and were the only passengers on a flight of 300+ people to be standing at the baggage carousel when it shut down because all the bags had been picked up by the passengers except for us. Our bags were missing. So now we head over to the missing baggage window and fill out a missing baggage claim form. This is Sunday morning. We make our way to the hotel with the clothes on our back for a week long stay to celebrate our anniversary not sure where our luggage is. We are tired. We have been on two flights for 10 hours. We wake up the next morning and put on the same clothes we arrived in to get breakfast. Never mind that there are new outfits in our luggage that we purchased for this trip that are floating around somewhere. After calling Aer Lingus multiple times and being told our luggage is out for delivery, we logged on to their missing baggage website only to learn our luggage has not been located yet in spite of Aer Lingus agents lying and telling us on the phone our bags were on the way. Was this so we wouldn’t go out and purchase necessary items to change into to keep Aer Lingus lost baggage costs lower. We are now in our 3rd full day in Italy and Aer Lingus still stands by their claim that one bag is out for delivery, when the truth of the matter is they can’t specify where it is en route. This saga will probably continue for us long after we depart Italy in two days. To add insult to injury, Aer Lingus cannot tell us what is acceptable and necessary that we can purchase while we wait hopelessly for our luggage. Talk about being given the run around, reading from a computer screen that the bags are in route, escalating our calls to supervisors who only read the same script on a screen. My Advice to Everyone out there - DO NOT BOOK YOUR FLIGHT through Aer Lingus if you value the peace of mind that you are entrusting a company that values it’s customers and will make a sincere effort to correct an error in a timely and honest manner. Let’s face it, a lot of people are like us, we don’t travel all the time, we spent thousands of hard earned dollars, and to be in Europe for going on four days in the same skivvies we arrived in should not be tolerated by customers - so book with another airlines if you value peace of mind.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,5/1/2023,Neutral,Satisfied,Satisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Boston,Naples,TRUE,Italy,FALSE,International
Aer Lingus,1,"""we are left to our own devices""","Welcome to post covid travel! I can accept many things, especially because of covid. Airline flights cancelled, lack of full staff, the list goes on. So, for this summer expect a whole lot of cancelled flights. So lets look at what a cancelled flight looks like in this post covid era. First off you'll get a message that your flight is delayed. Ok, so we'll just hang out in the club lounge a little longer, have a bite to eat, a beverage and just relax. Maybe an hour later check on how the flight is going and oh my! The gate looks like a scene at a border crossing: Its humid, its hot, there are people laying on the ground, babies are crying. Real hell on earth...well back to club for me! Then 3 hours after our plane should have left they announce flight cancelled. I go the gate and again see a scene of human misery, that's passengers I'm talking about, not Aer Lingus employees, they've booked it for the exits and gone home (probably high-fiving each other with, 'great job today!'). So we are left to our own devices and somehow all wonder to check-in like zombies out of a horror film (and the babies are still crying). An hour passes (it's now 10pm and we have been at the airport since 3pm) and word filters down that our luggage is in baggage claim. Off we all go to pick up our luggage (picture zombies trudging with a suitcase (and I wonder how those zombies with babies picked up their luggage?) Again we are at check-in with no Aer Lingus staff. Finally at 11pm someone who is not Aer Lingus starts to sort through this misery and give us direction, hotel, call this number, etc. And now for the zinger, not once, not at any time did any Aer Lingus staff show any humanity for the 3 or 6 month old babies that were crying. I saw one mother patiently comforting her baby in stoic solitude, showing her character and instilling in her baby what true character is.

After a two hour delay we were off. This was my first long haul with Aer Lingus post covid - a lot has changed. The bar came round once! What you are not told is there is no complementary wine with your meal just a tiny tiny cup of water. Luckily for me I ordered two drinks to see me through to past dinner. Food was OK - as soon as dinner was served the cabin staff disappeared and I mean disappeared! I found them all about 5 hours later literally hiding in the galley. I asked if I could purchase a bottle of water ( gone are the heady days when someone quietly came round the cabin asking if anyone required water on an 11 hour flight) no we have no bottles I was told. Some one took pity on me and gave me one from business class. As a walked back to my seat clutching my bottle other travellers gasped with cracked lips ""where did you get that"" that was going to LA on way back exactly the same issues only I told the line to buy water before boarding. We landed in Dublin to something described as a breakfast burrito (it was hell on earth) and to add insult to injury we were not even offered a coffee!

Their reason of course was that i did not cancel prior to the 14 days requirement. Obviously if I knew I would come down with COVID I would have cancelled with the 14day requirement being met. However, I could not have known I would contract covid less than 1 week before the flight. I find the very quick response denying my full refund to be an absolute bureaucratical decision, without any thought process being given to the extreme circumstances. I returned their email asking the person, if they would prefer that I travelled on their aircraft knowing that i had covid. to date I have not had a response. Terrible customer service skills and a terrible decision. They will now refund the $8300 minus 15% admin fees.

To start, when we arrived to check in (2 hours before boarding) there was already an announcement stating the flight was delayed by 1 hr. Once boarded we sat for an additional HOUR on the tarmac, causing us to miss our connecting flight home (amazingly the only flight of theirs that left only 15 minutes late). They re-routed us to Seattle, which meant an addition 2.5 hour layover before boarding the connecting flight. There was no offer of food or beverages even though we were missing our in-flight meal service. Once we boarded the connecting flight we AGAIN sat for 1 hour and 45 minutes in the tarmac. No offer of snacks or food. Mind you we are about 4 hours past when we should of had out meal service so we were starving. Thank god our last flight from Seattle to San Fran was with Alaska Airlines as they were great. So to sum things up, we were originally to be home at 3:30 pm on 9/2 but we didn’t arrive until 9/3 at 12 am and of course our baggage was still in Dublin, adding an additional 30 minutes in the airport to submit a claim for the lost bags.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""handled so poorly""","New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow in June 2019. Worst experience I've had with an airline. My flight from JFK to SVO, was continually delayed by Aeroflot without explanation. Even though the boarding time was never changed, we boarded over an hour late, then were told to get off after 80 minutes sitting on the plane without any sort of communication from Aeroflot staff about what was happening. They eventually claimed that they were trying to solve ""mechanical issues"" with the plane while we continued to sit on the plane. As I later heard airport staff commenting on, I have no idea why they boarded all of the passengers when they had clearly not solved the issue to begin with. To make matters worse, despite the flight taking off from New York (with many American and English-speaking passengers on board), most of the announcements were only made in Russian. After we got off, we were told that we would need to wait for up to 3 more hours to be notified about the status of our flight. We waited for almost 2 more hours before they canceled the flight - but, in fact, they did not admit to canceling the flight - instead, they claimed to have ""delayed"" the flight for a full 24 hours! Many passengers, myself included, were upset and frustrated, but this was not the end of the complete botching of this flight by Aeroflot. They seemed to have no planned response to this scenario. They herded us all upstairs to claim our luggage, and then had us wait in obscenely long lines to check in with two Aeroflot staff members  to claim an updated ticket for the 24-hour-delayed flight and/or a hotel voucher. After already being delayed for hours, we had to wait on these lines for at least an additional 1-2 hours. The worst part of this whole disaster was that Aeroflot claimed that they were not rebooking anyone's flight because the flight had not technically been canceled, it had been delayed (according to them). Most reasonable airlines release tickets once a flight has been canceled (as this one effectively had been, clearly) so that passengers can rebook on other flights, but Aeroflot was able to get around that by ""delaying"" the flight.  The staff that were handing out the new tickets and hotel vouchers were quite rude and displayed no sympathy for customers who had been treated so poorly by the airline already (I understand they were dealing with many angry customers, but they still could have at least apologized on the behalf of the airline, which they did not). Sure enough, even though I had a program in Tel Aviv that required my presence before the ""delayed"" flight's arrival, Aeroflot would not rebook my flight. I was lucky enough to have a travel agent for this trip, and they were able to demand that Aeroflot rebook my flight to another airline after a lot of frustration on their part, requiring me to rush to another airport after a whole night of no sleep.

The Flight 8686 also departed with about 15 minutes delay. On board,  I had to pay for coffee €2.50 for a regular coffee.  At that point I only wanted to get to my final destination. We landed in Bologna BLQ about 10 minutes late. There I had the final humiliation: my baggage was missing. I went to Baggage claim and was told that probably my suitcase was moved to a later flight which will land at night around 10:30pm. I filed a complaint form there and they told me they should call me if the baggage arrives and I would have to go back to the airport to pick it up. It is now 9:30pm and on the Air Berlin website there still no information about my baggage. This has been a horrible experience.

The aircraft servicing flight from Chicago to Berlin was very old, seats did not recline, majority of TV screens did not work, despite the crews effort to reboot the audio system. Normally, obstacles like this wouldn't impact me, but traveling with kids makes a big difference (try to explain to your child he won't be able to recline the seat or use TV on 9 hrs flight). Lastly, and most importantly, Air Berlin lost our luggage. There were about 30 + other passengers flying on the same flight who reported missing luggage. It is been a week and we did not hear back from the airline. We sent about 11 emails to different departments with copies of claim, lost baggage tags, etc. No response. Furthermore, none of the telephone numbers provided on the website are working numbers.

Air Berlin,1,"""Customer Service is non-existent""","This was my first time flying with Air Berlin on a trip from Chicago to Salzburg and a return flight from Prague to Chicago. It was the worst airline experience I have had in about 20 years of frequent flying. Here are some key reasons: Customer Service is non-existent. No one ever answers their phone number and their online service always returns an error message. I tried for two weeks both online and on telephone with one simple request, to upgrade my seat on my return flight (in other words, pay them more money!). One night, with Expedia on the line with me, we waited on hold for 95 minutes and I finally fell asleep at 1am. Also, with one exception on return flight, every single Air Berlin person I dealt with was not only extremely poor at customer service, but even rude. One flight attendant was just mean to the person in front of me who asked if they could give them their trash. Another flight attendant was rude when I asked a simple question at the counter. Another in baggage claim area in Berlin was rude. Their seats in economy are smaller than any other airline seat I have experienced. I had an eight hour flight with the seat back in front of me literally 10 inches from my face. I am 5 feet 5 inches and my knees hit the seat in front of me the whole time. Be aware they will charge you $60-100 extra just to pick a seat - any seat, including economy - in advance of your flight. The WIFI does not work. I paid for WiFi going over and back and was never able to get on it. The flight attendants were no help whatsoever and were again rude when I inquired The worst part was that I experienced two delayed flights - one from Berlin to Salzburg and one from Berlin to Chicago. Both were handled terribly. When I arrived late in Chicago to make my connection to MSP, I literally ran to the gate and got there in time to get on the flight, but Air Berlin without my consent or knowledge had changed my flight to a flight 4 hours later instead and American Airlines would not let me get on my original flight. When I called Air Berlin to complain about this while sitting in ORD for 4 hours, I again waited on hold for 2 hours and finally decided they did not deserve any more of my time or effort in giving them feedback. They probably won't even read this or care, but I wanted to alert other travelers - avoid this airline!",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,5/1/2017,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Chicago,Salzburg,TRUE,Austria,FALSE,International

There was nothing that I could say positive about this flight 7481 of Air Berlin departing April 8 from JFK to Dusseldorf. Arrived at JFK with more than 3 hours in advance. There were people in the priority /business line waiting because the two staff that attended the site, were gone for a break , and no other attendance paid attention to us. Suddenly another travelers that arrived after us were allowed to go through, and when I complained, a very young man responded that they were attending first the Berlin passengers (was no way this gentleman could know, without asking, whether I was going also to Berlin?) When we arrived at the time of boarding (we were told at the counter that there was going to be a 25 minutes delay), we had to wait for an hour without anybody explaining what was going on. We later found out that they had to switch the aircraft, and make the catering. When we finally boarded, never were we were approached by our names, I had to wear my jacket, since nobody came to ask for it. Food (bad catering), but that was not all. My dinner selection was Rissotto with a pinot grigio; the staff brought me the rissotto  with a red wine; when I told her that that was not my wine, and that I order the grigio, I think I spoke in esperanto, since she had no idea what I was talking about: I said white wine, and she said ok, and she never came back with the wine. Tire of waiting, I sipped a horrible red wine, and my wife took it and changed it for a chardonnay she was having. Dessert with the whole tray occupied with the other plates. The cabin was a mess, the flight staff spent the flight running, coming and going, and that is the reason why I did not have the chance to request for some better treatment.

I did a few flights with them with a few minor problems (delayed flights, delayed luggage); I kept using them as I had already a bunch of miles and a gold status, but the last one was very bad and is the last drop. Connecting in Berlin will require you to change terminals by walking outside and going over security again. Their lounges are so bad that are almost always worse than the comparable regular waiting areas from better airlines. A lot of their web site is not working, specially if you are accesing it from outside of Germany. Their phone app is buggy and of very limited functionality. It is very hard to get hold of them on the phone, you have to navigate a maze of menus to get there and then wait for long periods of time. Their phone service is very fragmented, once I get to talk with someone it often happens that he or she can not do what I need and I need to call again. My average has been four calls to get anything done; this is in total with waiting and menu navigation about 45 minutes. Their phone service is not 24 hours, if you are in a different time zone than Germany you may have to actually wake up in the middle of the night to call. It is practically impossible to make use of miles for flight upgrades in their own flights. It is effectively impossible to use their miles to upgrade or buy any service from other airlines on the network. Booking an award fligh on their own flights requires you to call them, again, this is difficult; you cannot do it online. My last return flight was cancelled and I arrived with a 12 hour delay back home, losing a whole work day; they didn't offer lounge access during my 12 hour wait at the San Francisco airport. Now they are delaying and dragging their feet with lots of bureaucracy to pay the compensation mandated by EU regulations. This is just what I can remember in one go, the list can go on.

Air Canada,1,"""support lines are totally overwhelmed""","I purchased a ticket to fly Washington-Nairobi return in business class via Toronto, Frankfurt and Zurich late June/early July 2023. All flights but the first were code shares on other reputable carriers, Lufthansa, Swiss and United. I've had excellent experiences with Air Canada in the past and really looked forward to this family trip. Just before departure, Air Canada cancelled its flight from Washington because of staff shortages. I called Air Canada and, secured a satisfactory booking via Montreal. That was almost immediately cancelled, leaving me trying to call Air Canada support till around 4am. After multiple calls and hours on hold, I was booked on a United flight to Toronto connecting with Lufthansa on to Nairobi. When I arrived at Washington Dulles, United reported that AC had only made a booking, but had not reissued my ticket as required AC staff at the airport said they were only ramp agents, they couldn't sort out the problem. I had to call Air Canada customer support. Eventually, they called AC support, waited 45 minutes on hold, and then had the needed ticket issued. I thought, foolishly, that my problems were over. Alas, AC had only reissued an outbound ticket from Toronto to Nairobi, without replacing the original round trip ticket. When I arrived in Nairobi, my return flight had disappeared from the Lufthansa system on the grounds that I was a no-show for the outbound flight, leaving me stranded in Nairobi. After an entire night and half a day trying to reach Air Canada support, AC staff finally agreed to restore my return ticket. Reaching AC took about an hour and a half on hold on each occasion, and AC dropped most of these calls after a few minutes. Only on arrival at Nairobi airport did I realize that AC had bungled my return ticket, having me depart Frankfurt for Zurich before I arrived in Zurich. Fortunately, the Lufthansa staff in Nairobi were able to sort this out on departure. I understand hat it's tough running an airline right now, resurgent demand, staff and plane shortages, forest fires etc. But the AC system demands that clients call their agents way more than should be necessary.

I was fortunate that passengers sitting each side of me were quite petite and were able to twist sideways a little for us all to fit. The entertainment system was good, although don't expect headphones to be provided by Air Canada. You can request earbuds that hurt after an hour or so of use, so make sure you bring your own nice headphones. The food was awful. I had ordered an Asian Vegetarian special meal - usually a safe bet for a bit of flavour on an airplane. It came warm on the outside and still frozen in the center. No bread or butter - it consisted of a small portion of plain cous cous, a some rice with a single cauliflower floret, and a tiny pot of tinned fruit salad. The regular meal seemed to be equally unappetising - chicken in tomato sauce. I noticed that my neighbours on the flight both left most of theirs. But at least they got a roll and a slice of cheese with their meal. I also had no drink with my meal, as they served all the special meals first before prepping the others, and they brink the drinks cart round after the regular meal cart.  The stewardess who seemed to be most in charge of things had an awful attitude with both passengers and her colleagues. Didn't see a single smile out of them the whole flight. You get a comically small bottle of water on the plane, but getting hold of anyone for another is an absolute mission. I managed to catch a stewardess as they were walking up the aisle to ask for some water, they just said that a bar service would be coming through shortly. It did, albeit an hour later, and that was the only time cold drinks were served on the flight. I also saw some poor victim get the same treatment from the other side of the aircraft - came to the galley to ask for a soda, told to return to his seat and they'd be coming through soon, which they didn't. The 2nd meal wasn't a meal, it was a small dry muffin. (That came with a salt and pepper sachet for some reason). I would avoid Air Canada like the plague. You expect better from a flag carrier, but I'd rather spend 9.5 hours on a budget short haul flight than fly AC again.

Air Canada,1,"""consistently and extremely awful""","I travelled round trip from Seattle to Punta Cana via Toronto. On the way there, there were several issues. First off, seats were highly uncomfortable. Furthermore, the cushions were poorly secured, and slid around underneath you. The leg room was nonexistent. I literally could not fit my knees in front of me on the plane.  There were no power outlets or Wi-Fi on the plane. The return flight was what really set this experience apart though. Terrible seats, no leg room, no amenities. However, the airline made a mistake scheduling the flight, causing it to be 3 hours delayed. Our layover was 3 hours and 40 minutes, which meant that we would have 20 minutes to get to our gate. We contacted the airline about this, and they assured us that we would easily be able to make our connection (quote “that is plenty of time to get there”), and that they would hold the plane back a few minutes to wait for us if necessary. Upon arriving after an uncomfortable and long flight, we could not make it to the other gate in time, and they refused to hold it back for us. The airline scheduled us flights to Seattle the next day, with a layover. We were supposed to get to Seattle Sunday afternoon, but our new flight plan had us arriving late Monday evening. We then waited over 2 hours in line at a very busy and crowded Air Canada service desk. the service was incredibly slow, but eventually they told us that there were much better flights we could have got that would have gotten us home much earlier, but they sold out in the time we stood in the line.

Unfortunately things went downhill from there on. Boarding was absolute mayhem with gate agents giving conflicting instructions. To make matters worse, instead of using the zone-based queues at the designated gate, they decided to use the lanes of the neighbouring gate causing a mass migration, not to mention confusion, for some 200 passengers. The gate agents were not only unorganized they were actually surly with the passengers. In the end it became a free-for-all boarding experience. When I got on board, I mentioned the chaos at the gate to one of the agents who was not even remotely interested in hearing about it and pretty much brushed it off. We were almost 40 minutes late leaving FLL which stretched the flight duration from 3 hours to 4 gate to gate. During this time the FA’s came around with water and beverage service only once and acted as if they were doing the passengers a favour. In all my travels around the globe I have never encountered a flight crew so aloof and uninterested in doing their jobs. The hard product was decent and the IFE had a good selection of movies, music and games. The washrooms looked like they had not been tended to in weeks and they surely were not going to receive any attention from the crew operating the flight.

The original flight was scheduled for July 8, 2021 and I had obtained a COVID test on July 6th which was negative. The fight from West Palm Beach to Washington was delayed about one hour and a half due to bad weather and therefore the connection to Toronto was missed by a few minutes. The notation on the display boards indicated that it was still boarding but it had departed by the time I got to the gate. I feel that the airlines must know that there are people wanting to connect on any fight and know which flights are delayed and which flights are arriving, therefore could have waited about 15 minutes to half an hour longer. A United Airlines customer service representative confirmed me on the earliest flight possible to Toronto which was the next day at 4:30 p.m. Was that the first possible flight with any airline or any connection? SO I had to stay at a hotel in the Dulles area from July 8th to July 9th. When I got to the Air Canada check in the next day I was still within the 72 hour limit for the COVID test and the attendant told me that they went by the flight departure time - which I had no control over - which was 4:30 p.m. a time difference of only a few hours. SO I had to take a RAPID COVID TEST which cost $250 U.S. at the Dulles airport right then.

After hours of being on hold trying to reach customer service via phone, it ended up being a waste of time as the line just disconnects. We decided to deal with it in person as we could never get a hold of a customer service rep. via phone. But low and behold, after arriving to our terminal gate, our seats were mixed up and we were seated separately. The rest of the ride is downhill from here.

Air China,8,"""Service was smooth""","I had serious concerns about this airline before taking my trip, but ended up having a very good experience. So I promised myself I will write a review about it. Best value for money: what caused me to book was the offer of flying a flat bed C-class seat from JFK to Shanghai for $2,200 (return tkt), only with a quick stopover of 90 minutes in PEK. Pre-flight concerns: - I kept receiving automated emails from the airline that my itinerary has changed and that I should contact them and I can change/get a refund for my tkt. The small change that happened once was a 5 minute change in departure time which increased my layover in PEK (good thing, since you need those 90 minute to transfer) - customer service: it's impossible to reach them by phone, the line is not manned. So I emailed them. They responded within 24hrs (or so) and said that my flight's transfer time in PEK is too short and my tkt needs to be changed. But when I went online I saw that my same exact flight itinerary was still being sold on various websites, incl. airchina.us. - The inconsistent response from their customer service really got me worried about the reliability of this airline, so I did some more research online on helpful reviews. I mostly read terrible reviews on how delayed the flights were, people missing their connections and being treated very poorly. That's when I got really worried about having booked this ticket, but figured I will take the risk. Also TPG wrote a fairly good review on them, so that felt comforting. Flight: - Outbound: upper deck of Boeing 747, half empty cabin. Seat was perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was smooth, food was good/fine - meat a bit chewy. Staff are friendly and helpful, though be aware they only speak limited english. - Inbound: Boeing 777-300 - full cabin. Seat perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was great, they accommodated my specific food requests despite not having ordered in advance. Overall a great flying experience. - All flights were pretty much on time - In-flight entertainment is ok, limited movies selection / limited music selection - no WIFI. Transfers in PEK: - 90 minutes is definitely needed if transferring. You need to take a quick 'airtrain' trip from domestic to intl., even if you don't change Terminals. The connecting flight to and from SHA was a tarmac parked aircraft with bus transfers, so that added time as well.

They made everyone wait in an area for forty minutes, then put everyone in a bus that got lost twice and took ninety minutes to get to a hotel. No food was provided, my bathroom had no shower door and had a clogged sink. I was the only Caucasian amongst all Chinese. Not a word of English was spoken. When flying from Los Angeles to Shanghai five days earlier the same thing occurred. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing was cancelled due to weather and I was forced to spend the night in Beijing. Rather than accept their accommodation I took the money they offered, forty six dollars and found a four star hotel that cost $250. Air Canada had its passengers stay at the same, pricey but reasonable, hotel. The following day, after spending three hours on the tarmac, without any communication from the pilots, the flight finally departed for Shanghai. Returning from Shanghai I was wiser but no less lucky. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing showed that it would be delayed and I knew I would miss my connecting flight to Los Angeles. An hour prior to the flight leaving I informed the airline staff that I would miss my connecting flight and requested they instead arrange another one. I even showed them flight options on my phone. The answer was no answer. I had to take the flight or be left on my own in Shanghai, not knowing what would happen. I took the flight to Beijing and was then taken to the hotel. I kept asking myself, why can’t Air China run some very simple regression analysis to determine the chances of customers making flights given variables like seasonal weather patterns and historic flight delays. The only answer I could come up with was they either do not think it is important or do not know how to do it. Why do airports in China suffer some of the longest delays in the world? As mentioned in the Economist, “The first reason is that its airports err on the side of extreme safety.” This is consistent with state run ideology. Play it safe. No mistakes, and you won’t get in trouble. According the South China Morning Post, “Like the rest of the world, the biggest cause of delays according to CAAC is the weather, which accounted for 56 percent of flight delays ” No one thinks this excuse is legitimate.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,7/1/2019,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Los Angeles,Shanghai,TRUE,China,FALSE,International

Apparently, for financial reasons Air China canceled both Friday and Sunday flights months ago but didn’t tell everybody. Now changing a very long, costly international flight is already a very poor customer service, but not making absolutely sure everyone realizes such a major change has happened is the worst I have ever seen in an airline. To make matters worse we had to fight to get a hotel and were sent to a very very poor, dirty one. Food was promised to be included but we got there only the buffet consisting of cold chicken nuggets and old eggs were included. Real food had to be paid. When every airline would be trying to make it up, since it was not my fault the flight was changed, getting a nice hotel and food, and an upgrade, Air China simply got us even worse service.

Air China,1,"""They just don't care""","New York to Bangkok via Beijing. I've been traveling for years and this is the 1st and last time I will ever use them. I just got married and my husband and I planned a 2 month honeymoon to Asia. We purchased a round trip from JFK with a layover in Beijing before arriving in Bangkok. The return flight was from Hong Kong with layover in Beijing before landing in Newark, NJ. Our flight in April to Bangkok experienced multiple delays which caused us to miss our layover in Beijing by 5 minutes. We actually had a 75 mins layover in Beijing, but due to the delays, we and almost everyone else on our plane missed our transfers. They couldn't tell their other planes to wait 5-10 mins for everyone to make their flights?? Instead, we saw most of the fliers crowded around the Air China counter. Everyone had to get a temporary visa and herd onto their buses to spend a night in a disgusting, filthy motel because the next flights out were the following day. My husband and I missed our 1st night in Bangkok and of course weren't reimbursed in any way. Throughout the ordeal, we saw all of the passengers at the Air China counters and they, like us, were appalled and furious with their lack of customer service. They just don't care. Now for our flight returning back to NY from Hong Kong on 6/17. We received an email saying that Air China changed our flights so we called Chase Travel. We saw that they changed the planes, times and moved us from Premium Economy to Economy. Why? We paid the extra amount for Economy. Once on the phone with Chase, we selected another flight for 7:30AM that was Premium Economy. We even waited on the phone until we received the email confirmation from Chase for our new flights. So on 6/17 we get to HK airport to check in and they only have my husband's name and not mine. Air China said I was on a 11PM flight and that it was Chase's fault. That was not the case. My husband and I spent hours on the phone with Chase and Air China, and Air China were the ones to cancel my ticket (we have no idea why). Instead of just putting me on the 7:30AM flight, they kept my husband on hold for 50 minutes, then finally told him that they could change his flight for $4000 to be with me for the 11PM. How does that make sense? Why are we being punished for Air China's mistake? They changed our flights then split us up but putting us on different flights that land in different airports. Then they have the audacity to tell him to pay $4000 for him to be on the 11PM when they could've just put me on the 7:30AM which was confirmed. They could have even put us on the next Air China flight after that. My husband ended up purchasing completely new flights with EVA which was $2800 compared to the $2500 round trip with Air China! It's now 7/25 and I've been on the phone with Chase for almost 4.5 hours because the supervisor is trying to get Air China to give us a refund.

It was extremely well designed with an excellent screen, solid table, privacy, ample storage spaces and the ability to locate switches and power points without searching too hard. We were offered a glass of champagne, juice or water before takeoff and given a very impressively comprehensive menu. I had pre-ordered the fish and it was incredibly tasty and excellently served by the cabin crew. I chose the delicious Chablis which seems to work well at altitude. It is an overnight flight and after the meal lights were dimmed. Although it was a flat bed seat I always believed that one sleeps better if it is at a slight angle – especially as aircraft never fly exactly horizontally. Despite only a blanket and pillow I had one of the most comfortable nights ever on an aircraft. I was awoken from breakfast and shown the omelette. This, I knew, never works that well but it was still tasty and accompanied by bread and fruit. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were absolutely excellent. Every request was answered and they were friendly, funny at times, very French (of course) and a credit to the airline.

Delta re-routed me ATL-CDG-LIS via partnership with Air France, and give me an upgrade to ""Business"" (due to the equivalent class was not available, but the ""Business"" still shows availability.) At the gate, Air France counter person insulted me: ""You have only paid $300 and want to fly Business""? I was trying to inquire if she was looking at my ATL to JFK portion of fare as I actually paid 3 times as much for my round trip. After she downgraded me and issued my ATL-CDG boarding pass, I requested the second portion (CDG-LIS), and told her I wanted to see a manager. She yelled at me: ""I am the manager!"" when I requested to see her badge (as she was wearing her badge front side inward), she replied: ""You cannot see my badge."" When I insisted, she said: ""I am deboarding you now!"" and she did knock on the keyboard to start the deboarding! At this time, a Delta counter person printed out CDG-LIS boarding pass for me. The nightmare continued in CDG when I was told I was not in Air France systems, so I cannot fly to LIS. However, the lady at CDG counter immediately escalated and resolved the situation.

It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why.

On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back.

Air New Zealand,1,"""They do not care about their customers""","Due to the pandemic, I have been unable to fly with this airline as of yet. My entire experience with this airline and their service dealing with pandemic related issues was the most frustrating and financially costly experience I have ever had with any airline. My family bought tickets to fly out during the spring of 2020, which for obvious reasons fell through. Over the course of the following two years, we pursued every possible avenue to receive a refund for those tickets as we were either unable to fly due to pandemic restrictions in the US and New Zealand, or in the case of this year, members of my family became financially incapable of travel. Even though we reached out many times to make our case for getting out money back so we could travel when everything was safe and we were all financially stable again, the airline refused to budge on the issue. I ended up having to call in to their service line to personally address the issue rather than approach it through emails. Even after years of dealing with our tickets being held up in purgatory and our financial situation getting worse, the final nail in the coffin came today as I received a $175 phone charge for the 44 minutes I had to be on the phone to get half of my family's money back. After years of dealing with this airline, they only chose to refund us a little less than half of the money that we had to contribute, and only because that was the money we were forced to pay in order to maintain our tickets the last time the cost went up. We still have thousands of dollars held up in tickets we may never be able to use. Always get fully refundable tickets from this airline, do not accept their Disney dollars, and do not give them the opportunity to screw you. They do not care about their customers, and after I take this flight some time in the next few years, whenever my family is financially able to, I will never fly with them again. If they would have refunded us the first few times we tried, I would happily fly with them again, but their terrible customer service and lack of respect for the situations many of their passengers find themselves in during these uncertain times leaves me furious and defeated.

The company recently had a workers strike that caused them to cancel multiple flights. The issue here isn’t the strike, it is how ATN handled it.

My wife and I talked about taking this trip 10 years ago when we got married. We saved our money, spent the last 7 months planning, and then flew to LAX the day before our flight to PPT via ATN. Less than 23 hours before take-off, they cancelled the flight. They provided nothing more than general statements saying they were in the process of rebooking. Then nothing but silence. My wife called their representatives later in the day and were told that we would have a flight out THAT DAY and would be contacting us. Then more silence, nothing. Again called in and were offered a flight 4 days from now, cutting our trip on half. Absolutely unacceptable. We ended up not getting rebooked, not receiving any direct communication from ATN, and had to cancel our trip. If they had been more prepared for this contingency, as most competent enterprises are, they would have had plans in place in why to do when this happens. Instead, we lost our chance to go to Bora Bora.

Air Tahiti Nui,1,"""Business Class product was terrible""","Their lack of care, lack of support and lack of customer service is monumental. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and heading to Bora Bora. Air Tahiti from LAX to Papeete and then on Air Tahiti (regional carrier) to Bora Bora. About 2 hours prior to our late night flight, Air Tahiti Nui cancelled the flight. The reason was that the incoming aircraft was struck by lightning. Understanding that safety is paramount and absolutely the most important factor of traveling, we understood that the aircraft had to be inspected. Keep in mind that Air Tahiti Nui only has like 4 aircraft in their fleet so it's not like they can quickly bring in a new aircraft. We were shuttled to an airport hotel at LAX and told to come back in the next day as the flight would now depart at 2pm. Back to LAX we went and learned that Air Tahiti Nui kept delaying the flight with no information or communication to the passengers. When a Gate Agent did appear, we were advised that they are third party employees and have no further details. All this while we were watching tape being put on the front of the aircraft where it was struck by lightning. After hours again in LAX, the flight finally departed. Upon arrival in Tahiti there was no one from Air Tahiti Nui to provide hotel vouchers (as the majority of passengers were connecting to neighboring islands and there were no regional flights out that late). There was a line of about 200+ passengers waiting for some assistance from one woman sitting in the Air Tahiti office! After hours of waiting we were put up in literally a dump of a motel for the night. Knowing that the flight was cancelled the previous day, why would they not have staff ready to assist their passengers as well as hotel vouchers for those stuck in Papeete. Take my recommendation, fly an alternate carrier if going to Tahiti. Their Business Class product was terrible. 2x2x2 seating on a 787 where others offer plenty more room.

This caused an issue because in order to gain access to any club lounge you need a boarding pass. Our flight arrived in LAX about 5 hours before the LAX to PPT departed so had to sit and wait in LAX for 3 hours until Air Tahiti Nui ticket counter opened. By that time there was a long line of people and the staff at Air Tahiti Nui did not seem to care how fast they processed people. So we were not able to go to our lounge and eat and relax so we had to pay for our lunch and stand around because of very limited seating in the lobby of LAX. After checking our bags we went to the gate displayed on my ticket and on the overhead boards and on my flight app. Several people started going up the the gate ticket counter asking why boarding had not started with only 10 minutes before our flight was suppose to depart. No answers. Staff simply did not seem to care.

The attendants aboard the flight were efficient, responsive, cooperative, and professional. I can't think of anything else to say about the staff. The food onboard the flight was just like your generic airline food. It was cold, slimy, and disgusting. I recommend purchasing food and snacks prior your flight in the terminal.

We did that, arrived at the American Airlines counter who told us that we needed a transit visa for Sydney and Air Tahiti should have known this. Also told us there were no seats and we had missed the flight. We ran back to the Air Tahiti counter in the previous terminal. Again staff just joking around, had no knowledge of transit visas. Spent next 30 minutes trying to get us on another airline. Qantas this time. We ran to that counter with one helpful staff member, checked in and Qantas sorted our visas. Stroller was lost in transit. Flight they placed us on meant a 9 hour wait in Sydney before our final journey to NZ.

The other plane we flew in their fleet had a larger tablet screen and usb port for charging. The crew did what they needed to do but nothing more, unless you buzzed them or fly business class.

I reached out to Air to Sea and they said no problem, just download the apps and change seats. On my flight there I was booked on American Airlines. I went on the app, easily upgraded to first class, the staff was super helpful, and they even upgraded my entire family for free! The flight was comfy, the staff on the plane were great, and I had zero panic attacks. Not the same experience with Alaska Airlines. They would not help me. They told me we had plenty up upgrades available and it was a small fee to upgrade. Then the staff said never mind we can't help you because you went through Air to Sea. So we called Air to Sea that said they can't help because the airline does not allow them to see first class. After going back and forth we got both sides on the phone at the same time where Alaska Airlines said they would upgrade us for over $1,000 a ticket! Wow. Horrible customer service, very petty because we booked through Air to Sea, treated us terrible like we had done something wrong, not to mention plenty of seating they are refusing to sell us.

The flight attendants were fairly inattentive to their movements and rammed into me multiple times, despite being fully out of the aisle. When beverage service started i spent a solid 5 minutes with the second seat flight attendant's bum repeatedly being shoved in my face.

The curtain separating first class is not tied/otherwise secured, and i spent 90% of the flight with it flapping in my face (seat C6). This airline is one of the worst I've had the misfortune to fly with. Every trip has been subpar, but to charge for premium seating and  cram people in like sardines in this row is outrageous.

Alaska Airlines,1,"""so uncomfortable and sad""","Let me start this rant by saying I fly a lot, usually with Delta, but occasionally with AA if they have a quicker route, then transfer to Alaska airline for the last leg of my trip into Nome (Delta doesn’t fly there). I’ve NEVER had any complaints about a flight crew - ever. Instead, I’m the person watching out for the flight crew - completely in awe of the long shifts they work and the kindness they show to each of us. Always grateful for all they do. Like everyone else, often bewildered by the general rudeness of some of the public towards the staff. That was NOT my experience today 1/5/23. Alaska airline flight had a quicker route that sent me through Portland to Anchorage, so I chose it. Because of the amount of miles I fly, I typically get upgraded to first class (even if I don’t purchase). Today, there was no first class seats for purchase, so I ended up sitting in business class, exactly one row behind first class. I was completely fine with that. Again, no complaints. The reason for the rant. I had a horrible experience today. My Alaska airline flight 197 was delayed approx. 1 - 1.5 hours. The flight was originally a late night flight anyway, so this just made things a bit worse, but completely understandable. Things happen. The flight crew can’t control when the plane arrival/departure. However, 3 hours into my delayed flight, while everyone was sound asleep, absolutely no movement at all throughout the plane, complete graveyard silence, I got up to use the restroom and walked to the closest one (literally 5 rows in front of me) in first class. A beautiful blonde flight attendant walked up to me and told me to turn around and go to the restroom in the back. Again, no one was up in the aisles or in line for either restroom. Everyone was asleep. It absolutely floored me - really embarrassed me as the gentleman sitting next to me overheard it and rolled his eyes as I had to turn around. I see people from business class use first class restrooms all the time. I’ve never been offended. I’ve never seen anyone rerouted to the back. Anyway, I went to the back restroom and asked the two flight attendants working the back if there was a policy or some rule that I was unaware of. Minutes later - the two attendants in the back - rushed to the front to ”tell on me”. Then for a absolutely NO reason, they proceeded to make an announcement over the intercom to everyone - instructing non first class people to use the back restroom - mind you - NO one except me was had been or was up moving around. My concern, do they commonly bully people that are not in first class? Do they make a point to try and embarrass customers? The announcement was petty and team bullying. For the first time, I understand why people speak up and confront flight attendants for treating them poorly. I get it. They have you in a position of submission while your traveling. It’s so uncomfortable and sad. I suppose the lesson for me - always fly Delta, but more importantly, be mindful of how people who don’t have the means to fly first class are being treated as they may not be the “rude” passengers I once thought that they were to flight staff.",Business,Business Class,1/1/2023,Satisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Satisfied,Satisfied,Satisfied,Satisfied,Portland,Nome,TRUE,United States,TRUE,Domestic

No meals available for those who didn't pre-book a meal. Flight was 5 hours and the full evening, so I had no dinner. Instead, charged me for my ""snackbox"" purchase from the two economy options. When confronted on why I wasn't given a meal / why they didn't have enough, they pointed to another customer and explained that they gave it away to him.

Alaska Airlines,1,"""the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way""","Alaska airlines, we will never fly with you again. All excited to take our daughter who loves flights on her first flight, and the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way. We let the woman at the gate know it was her first flight and asked if they still got wings and an opportunity to see the cockpit, and the response, ""well it's case by case but I'll tell the flight crew"". Board the flight, no one knew it was her first flight, so whatever we make our way to our seats. Daughter (who just turned two) is now crying because she couldn't see, ok no problem we didn't promise anything to her. We had purchased her a seat so she could have some space, but she only wanted to be held when the plane took off. Still crying and stewardess who was either having a bad day, or clearly has no kids, tells us she ""must be strapped into her own seat"". I explained she was crying and would be better for everyone if we could just comfort her, she gives a nasty look and says ""nope, strap her in"". Wonderful, cue hysterical baby, sorry everyone around us. At this point my child is crying hysterically, borderline throwing up, so we pick her up to comfort her (we were at a stand still on the ground, not even moving or ready for take-off), and here comes stewardess number 2. She clearly sees what's going on and we explain we just need a couple moments to settle her, she looks over at stewardess number 1 who shakes her head, and tells us we have no choice but to strap her in. So I apologize to everyone around us, and my wife and I try to console our hyperventilating daughter who continues to cry inconsolably, till we reach altitude and we are able to rip her out of the seat and settle her. First wave of drinks come out and we are completely disgusted with these woman, and stewardess number one walks over and tosses a set of wings at my wife full of attitude and says ""somebody's first flight eh"". Laughs like she had enjoyed this whole thing. Total train wreck, daughter throws up all over both of us because she was so upset, and no one cared. Another family in the row across from us with a baby was completely disgusted, these two women were acting the way they were. Oh and just to round out the 5+ hour flight from hell, the extremely over-priced wifi I paid for to play a movie and settle our daughter, would not work. It took barely 1 hour of restarts, paid time outs, credit card time outs, and buffering to get it to barely play movie. The movie timed out twice for now reason and when it finally came back the third time the speaking didn't match the peoples mouths. Tried to open a couple games and those wouldn't work because of the wifi either. Several people around us had the same struggles and some asked for refunds and were just left staring at the seat in front of them. Of the hundreds of thousands of miles I have flown, I have never been so disappointed and let down. Pilots who cant be bothered to greet kids. Flight attendants acting angry and vindictive, while also apparently enjoying acting that way. No monitors on a 5+ hour flight and garbage over-priced wifi instead.

Alaska Airlines,1,"""rude customer service representative""","We had a layover in Seattle on November 29th. Once we got there our second flight was canceled after waiting 2 hours for the delayed flight. The customer service line was extremely long. After about an hour in line I finally reached a customer service agent to help me get my flight changed. By that time there were no available seats on any flights that day, but I had been trying to change my flight while in line and I got a confirmation for a 9pm flight. When I stated that to the rep, she said they had double booked the seat that I was assigned to, but that she will get my on the flight since the other person had not checked in yet. She printed my ticket and handed it to me. After that I asked if there would be any compensation as we were supposed to be home by 12pm and now we had to wait until 9pm for potentially another delayed or canceled flight and this has already been hard on my family. The rep provided no help whatsoever and explained not-so-nicely that because this was not Alaska’s fault, they are not responsible for providing compensation. This made me wonder, what would be considered “their fault”, or is this some fine print that they can get out of any compensation. By this time it had stopped snowing for a couple hours and everything was melted. I couldn’t understand why all other flight carriers were taking off and landing just fine, yet Alaska had to cancel our flight completely. I understood the delay in the de-icing. I asked why it is our fault that Alaska doesn’t have this figured out. Even on the Alaska’s website it stated that they had flights prepared for the upcoming weather and that they had it all figured out. The rep started to get frustrated with me and started getting snarky. She stated that “if we give you compensation, we had to give everyone in this line compensation”. To which I replied “you should”. She continued to ramble about this weather is causing delays and I told her to look outside and I said “what weather?” Again in hadn’t been snowing and I was irritated that this was the excuse when everything was melted and it wasn’t snowing. She yelled at me and stated “Give me back your tickets”. So she was threatening to take my tickets away for the only available flight out for the rest of the day?! I was appalled! I stated “no” you cannot take my tickets. She started getting irate and stated she has been working here for 15 years and that she is working overtime and she shouldn’t even be here, that she should be home. I couldn’t believe she was escalating things as a customer service rep of 15 years, when she should be helping me out. I stated I should be home by now too! I really felt like I was calm throughout the whole conversation and yet she continued to escalate the conversation. At the end of the interaction I stated that “You will be losing a customer, not that you care”. And she said extremely snarky “No, I don’t think we will”. I said “Excuse me, you don’t think you will what?” She reiterated, “I don’t think we will be losing a customer”. What type of rude customer service representative did I just encounter? Is it my problem that she is overworked? I felt attacked and vulnerable as she tried to take away my only way of getting my family home. I asked for her name and she would not provide me her last name.

No food. We are now boarded and informed we are stopping in Liberia even though our boarding pass shows direct to LAX.

I said I needed help I was told ""you have to put your luggage up here"". So a disabled woman tripping and falling over a cane managed to put up a 50 pound piece of luggage. Only after did the incompetent woman ask if I needed assistance? I had asked for help three times and was told no! So I said - if I'm required and able to lift a 50 pound suitcase by myself, I will get myself down to the gate since Alaska Airlines is useless. On my way from Anchorage to Boston I took Delta - I had to pay/tip every person who touched the wheelchair - and I still had to pick up my own baggage? I got to the gate myself bumbling through TSA, who wondered why I didn't have help. When I said I was with Alaska Airlines, they won't help - the woman said ""Ah - yes Alaska Airlines, no, they are not much help"" and she proceeded to help me. I arrived at the gate and was immediately pursued by an irate employee asking me loudly my name - and very loudly stating they have to fill out a form for when a customer requests assistance but refuses the wheelchair. I quietly explained the situation, and he continued to chastise me, mimic my words - told him to rip it up. No problems here. He refused. He got louder and more obnoxious. He demanded an explanation - I said, if you're going to make me lift a 50 pound bag by myself, after I kept asking for help - I figure I'll be better off getting myself to the gate. I regret not filing a report on this guy, but I have sympathy because its very difficult to get competent help in Massachusetts or Logan airport.

I got a round trip from San Jose to San Diego with my family and among the free items you can check-in are strollers and car seats. On the first flight we were able to check-in for free our son's car seat and wagon-stroller for free. We even called ahead days in advance to ensure we could take our wagon-stroller with us for free. However on the return flight we had to pay to document and check-in the wagon-stroller. The handling of situation was terrible from Alaska. They argued that wagons are not strollers but failed to show any Alaska documentation of their definition of a strollers as ours has seat belts for the kids and can fold to fit the size of large stroller but has a wagon shape. The personnel argued that double strollers were fine but ours was not (even though our could be smaller). We showed them the model on the internet (which states it is a stroller wagon) and even when you search on google for strollers images of this type show on top along the traditional strollers. They argued that allowing us to check-in our ""wagon"" for free during our first flight was a mistake. To make matters even worse, the personnel argued that we use the stroller to carry our stuff which is besides the point as you can do that why any stroller. This suggested to me that Alaska didn't care whether this was a stroller or not and made it harder to actually get an understanding of the rules rooted on Alaska's policies, which Alaska was not able to provide. Along this lines (about not really being helpful) and taking their attitude to a different level, one of the personnel we were having the conversation in order to try to ""solve"" the problem threatened us by saying ""do you want to fly today?"". Not sure what this person was thinking but that only make this experience worse. In the end a more cool headed personnel came in, acknowledged our frustrations and provided a number we can use to complain. This frustrating and unpleasant experience was a result of the poorly documented, inconsistent policies and communication channels at Alaska, and exacerbated by the even worse customer service from Alaska employees at the San Diego airport.

I had just arrived on a 13 hour flight from New Zealand, arriving at LAX and needing an onward flight to SFO. I checked in via a kiosk for the SFO flight and I was lucky enough to be offered a $20 upgrade to First Class which I logically accepted. Everything went seamlessly from check in, right through to priority boarding on the plane which was an Embraer ERJ 175. I was so impressed with the way the First Class team member dealt with a very self obsessed passenger who was demanding a lot of attention in the First Class cabin. At no stage did the team member lose it with this passenger and she remained professional and cordial at all times. I was actually sorry the flight was so short as the service was so good. The flight back on 5th July was on an Airbus A320. Check in was painless but TSA was a nightmare as everyone was flying home after the 4th. We were probably just over an hour late departing. This flight was just as enjoyable, very slick and polished and I have no qualms about using Alaska while flying internally in the US.

After they boarded, everyone on the flight got the run around as to why they were delayed and then had to get off the flight and got rebooked for the following day, July 14th for 3pm. For some reason they were told to get off the plane but their luggage somehow made it to Seattle, which was an absolute nightmare because my partners son doesn't live with us, nor his friend, so they didn't have anything as to clothes or toiletries for the next day, except whatever they were wearing. My partner's friend and son waited about 6 hours after the supposed initial take off at the airport due to the delays, with three of those hours getting the run around as to where their luggage is. My partner had to leave work to go pick them up. I get on the phone with Alaska that evening after work to try to find out where their bags are and to get compensation for the whole deal. We told Alaska to not send it back to Portland if they weren't able to get it that night, to just send it to Albuquerque, which they reassured us. They gave us a $50 voucher for each to get underwear, socks, and stuff for the night and told us to call customer care in the morning. I called customer care in the morning and the lady was just God awful, no help what so ever. I asked for a refund on the $60 luggage fee since they didn't get have their luggage and thought that was a fair compensation. We were told Alaska doesn't do refunds and put me back on the phone with baggage. Baggage reassured us that the bags would be in Albuquerque when they landed. Well they landed in Albuquerque to find out that their luggage was sent back to Portland and they will fly it back to deliver it later to their address sometime this week or next week. Seriously? First Alaska delayed their flight until the next day, gave us the run around and we lost work hours, can't give us a straight story on the luggage claim, and when we ask just for the a refund on the $60 luggage fee they so no, we don't do refunds but here's a $50 voucher for a future flight. How about no, we are never flying Alaska Airlines again. I flew Southwest last year and my flight was delayed 4 hours, they gave me a $100 voucher without even asking. Seriously Alaska?

Allegiant Air,1,"""So disappointing and astounding""","I write reviews a lot online, and 95% of the time, I only write reviews for positive interactions. I feel that negative reviews are generally screwed by emotion, frustration, or anger. And that we have enough negativity in our world. So I try to keep things positive. In this case, I think it’s necessary to document the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced - which came from Allegiant phone customer service. I have never been treated so poorly by an employee of a company that I’ve spent hundreds of dollars patronizing (or any company, for that matter). There was a mix-up when my family flew in for a visit. Their return flight was canceled after they missed an outbound flight, and when we realized this (the night before their return flight), I called to understand the situation. Originally, the gate agent told them their return flight would not be canceled but that they could keep it. So we were surprised when we couldn’t find the reservation for them to check-in. The person who I talked to on the phone to try to fix the problem was unbelievably rude. After discussing the situation, she didn’t believe my family because the agent didn’t make notes, and her attitude toward me was unlike any experience I’ve ever had with a customer service person. I intentionally did my best to stay calm, not raise my voice or have a frustrated or angry tone and asked to speak with her supervisor after she yelled at me. After continuing to be berated by the employee, I calmly continued to ask to talk with her supervisor. She denied me the opportunity several times (she said the supervisor couldn’t help) and eventually *hung up the phone on me!* I understand and can appreciate how hard customer service jobs must be. So again, I did everything possible not to talk down to this person or raise my voice. And I was hung up on. I don’t understand how this airline could possibly prioritize basic respect for one another if this was how their employee acted. I assume they are not teaching patience or customer care (human care) in any fashion. Honestly, nobody should be treated with the disrespect this person showed. The way I was treated was not worth saving a little money to fly cheaply. I could not get this person's name or employee information and am not sure how to follow up on such an extreme situation, so I’m writing a review online in hopes of steering others away from such a challenging circumstance and genuinely negative interaction with another human being. Our world has enough trouble and challenges these days; there should be no reason to experience interactions like this one, especially in a professional setting.

Our flight was originally suppose to leave at 4:00 but was delayed due to some reason that was never made clear. After hours of waiting, there was another flight scheduled to leave for this same route at 6:48, but instead of putting us on that plane like they should’ve done since we’d already been waiting for several hours, they let the original passengers take flight, while making us wait for our plane to arrive. Our plane finally arrives and we board the plane around 7:10. After waiting for about an hour to take off, the pilot informs us that the vehicle that was supposed to taxi the plane won’t start and we’ll have to get off the plane until they can “formulate a solution” really? They only have 1 vehicle that can taxi the plane in the whole freaking airport? So that brings us to now, it’s currently about 8:30 and we are all sitting here with no idea what’s going to happen.

Allegiant Air,1,"""scores minus zero in my book""","I was not able to actually take the trip for the ticket I purchased. According Allegiant's website, changes would be easy to make if necessary and only required a $25 fee. I attempted to make changes on Thanksgiving Day and could not reach them by phone, email, or the chat feature on their website. Hold times were in excess of 3 hours. Understanding this is the case during the holidays, I kept trying to reach them until I finally reached someone 4 days later by setting my alarm to wake me up at 4:00 a.m. so that I could call them. At this point, I was outside of the 7-day window, but tried to explain to the representative that I'd been trying to reach someone well before the 7-day advance notice requirement for changes. The key word here is that I ""tried"" to explain. The representative I spoke to was the rudest person I think I've ever reached in a customer service department. She kept cutting me off and reciting what sounded like a script that she was reading off of her computer screen. By the time she was finished listing all of the applicable fees, she said my $200 ticket was really only worth $23. I asked to speak to a supervisor and again attempted to explain the extenuating circumstances under which I needed to make a change, but she continued to rudely cut me off mid-sentence. Finally I was so angry I just hung up the phone. The airline needs to anticipate high call volume around holidays and still provide a means of communication with its customers. I was assured by the website that my email would receive a response within 24 to 48 hours, but now almost 2 weeks later I still haven't heard from anyone. They should also train their phone representatives to have some common courtesy and allow customers to speak and not treat everyone as if they're stupid. Let me also add I actually drove 45 minutes to the airport to speak to a representative in person, but there was not one single Allegiant employee at the airport that I could speak to.

My bag was smaller than many on the plane. Ended up being fine but she added a lot of stress and irritation to the flight down. Also their bag weight is 10 lbs less than almost every other airline in an effort to squeeze more money out of the passengers who are already flying this airline due to limited funds. On the flight home over thanksgiving weekend we arrived 3 hrs before boarding to reduce stress and ensure no issues getting on the flight. We waited in line for 30 minutes only to be told they would not take our bags until 2 hrs prior to check in. All other airlines are 4 hrs. I was uncomfortable with this and asked about the long line at security as well as boarding being so early and doors being closed 10 minutes before departure on way down. She said you can do priority bag check and the lines at security shouldn’t be that bad. So I am currently stuck outside security with no seats, no food or drinks and stressing out as I watch the security line hoping we can rush through in time to catch our flight.

American Airlines,1,"""at least have the decency to be honest""","American Airlines itself is a decent airline, but the fact that approx. 5 - 7% of their flights are direct flights is a capital crime. Almost every trip requires a connection, with about 85 - 90% of those connections being in Charlotte. It is kind of funny that lot of the budget airlines, like Spirit & Frontier among others offer a majority of direct travel all across Canada & The US. How is American Airlines not jumping on this. Honestly, a stopover is not bad, especially if you love flying, like I do. However with American, a stopover is a bittersweet thing. Firstly, a stopover could be anywhere 40 minutes to 1 hour. Hearing that you initially think ""OK, not bad at all"" then you have your first flight delayed for a bogus reason, rendering your connection pointless, which is frustrating. Frustration increases usually because with American Airlines, your first flight will be an evening flight, and after the delay, you get to your connection 1 hour late if not more, and you have to stay all night in the airport to get your connecting flight first thing in the morning. Yay! If you are lucky to get a representative at a ticket booth, which will be few & far between if that, you will be given some sort of miss-information in regards to why your flight was delayed. After finding out that upgrading my seat from aisle to window, would be $54, US as well. That's fun! American Airlines screws up and still wants to charge for trying to rectify the situation. Like us customer are the inconvenience. After saying no, I actually had a representative tell me ""You can certainly book a flight with United"" what kind of answer is that. Your airline messes up and your advice is have a customer pay more money with a different airline. Alright then! WiFi on American is not the best either, unless you are a Xfinity or Verizon member. If not, don't expect any internet access besides the American Airlines site allowing you to check other American Airlines flights to see your connecting flight is on time and knowing you will miss it. Prices for WiFi on the airline range from $15 - $20, just to use the WiFi on 1 device only. Oh Joy! I do realize airlines screw up sometimes, it's a part of travel. The whole ""it's about the journey, not the destination"" thing. However, at least have the decency to be honest with customers about what is going on and try to accommodate them. The very least you can do is try to keep the customer. At least with your own airline. As much as I love flying, a direct flight is certainly better than this headache I endured. American, please get your stuff together. Remember, you are not the only airline in the skies.

A very nice woman helped me and she fixed it and checked my luggage. And I got my luggage tickets and my luggage was marked priority. When I went to check in at the gate I was told to step aside. A female agent said the ticket not in the system despite my having my boarding pass. So she asked a male agent to assist me. He was extremely mean and rude. He said I wasn’t on the flight. I showed him my confirmation email, my e-ticket that showed my seat number and he said it didn’t matter. I don’t exist in in the system. He then assigned me a new seat in economy. I told him I paid for a first class ticket. He said you didn’t tell me that. Ask for a refund. Had he actually looked at my ticket he would’ve seen that I was first class. I didn’t want to make scene so I moved on. When I passed through the first class cabin my seat was empty. I do not know if it filled after, but I was one of the last ones on the plane. I imagine it went empty. I probably should have just showed my e ticket and I could have sat down, but honestly I was so taken back by the way I was just treated I wasn’t thinking. I have sent an email to my travel agent to ask her how I can get a refund of the difference. I fly first class because I fly frequently and it helps me to me rested for important meetings. I spend a lot of my hard earned money. I was treated horribly by the agent at the gate. I do not tolerate that behavior and do not reward it with further business. I can tell you, I will absolutely never fly American Airlines ever again and I will never recommend them to any body ever again based on my experience on this particular trip.

My first flight out I missed by 5 mins even though I watched them give other stand by people my seat. There was a bad storm that delayed everyone. I was put on stand by 3 times before I’m like no this can not be the solution. My 3rd visit to customer service was met with limited reps and basically the last rep showing no empathy after I’ve been running around the entire airport for 7 hours just to get oh no the flight is overbooked. I ended up just purchasing a new ticket through JetBlue and let my anxiety not get the best of me. The reason I missed my flight is because pre-check took 40 mins to get through. No one had a sense of urgency. 10 people missed my flight so don’t you think that’s a big issue. I get it if it was only me but 10. The same people running from flight to flight.

While in line for customer support (which was forever long) we were the next people in line and a worker pulled two groups to go to a gate worker to get the line down. We said no we wanted to stay, we were next in line. He told us we had to so another 2 hours later we are still in line at the gate and the gate worker had no clue what he was doing. So I went back and stood in line again at customer service. I made it to the front again before my husband moved so I called him to come back over. At the gate the worker would not look up where another customers bag was because they said over and over again that if you don’t make it on a flight neither does your bag. So at customer service we were very nice in which we did not get in return. Asked us why we didn’t know what flight we were on? Told us they rebooked us for 6 pm the next day. There were no hotels, no rental cars. So our only option was to stay at the airport for close to 20hrs. With no solution or compensation or anything. We then asked her if she could check where our bags were, in which she told us that if we didn’t get on the flight neither did our bags. We asked again if she could just check. So she did and was very annoyed about it and sure enough, our bags were on the flight without us.

We were informed it was canceled due to the incoming flight crew from New York being unable to continue on with our fight due to the delays it incurred. While there getting the bad news with everyone else, we overheard a lady mention that this was the third day in a row the same American Airlines flight had been canceled on her. Due to American Airlines inability to plan ahead and swap flight crews to enable us to fly later that evening when the plane did arrive, it caused us to have to cancel our vacation entirely. When we called American Airlines directly after we were told the flight was canceled, a representative told us they could not get us on another flight to our destination within the next few days. The customer service rep did slip up and say there was another flight with seats on it the next day but the seats were marked up to $4K each and he told us he could not put us on that fight! Due to American Airlines inability to plan ahead or get us on the next flight I was not able to see my Daughter who flew out of Houston to see us, my brother and his children or my Mom and Step-Dad all of whom I have not seen for over a year. I am in the Military and nothing is more disappointing than not getting to see my family the few times a year I can, especially when it's due to an airline company failing to uphold their end of a ticket purchase! Also, due to the last-minute flight cancelation, the non-refundable costs we incurred include; TWA hotel @JFK, our portion of the destination accommodations, and Airport parking for the day we waisted sitting there. My brother also flew American weeks before and had his flight canceled on him two times before he finally made it to his destination. The customer service was horrible when we were on the phone, they did nothing to assist us and were not able to answer most of the questions we had pertaining to our cancelled flight!

American Airlines,1,"""horrific disaster""","Our mission trip to Africa was cancelled due to travel in vain. The airline failed to get us to our destination, it is as simple as that. There were 23 of us traveling together, all leaving from Albuquerque. Our American Airlines connection in Dallas was delayed so we missed our connecting Qatar flight which then spiralled into a nightmare of trying to get our flights rebooked for 48 hours. We were told that our tickets were booked and that our luggage would only go where our tickets specify (by multiple agents from Qatar and American) only to find out when we went to check in that our flights had not been rebooked, and later that our luggage was not remotely attached to our tickets (but halfway around the country or world without us). The nightmare we went through trying to get American and Qatar to talk to each other to make sure our flights were actually booked was an unacceptable fiasco that no paying customer should ever have to go through. We went back and forth between the two counters dozens of times only to find out each time that their systems would not work with each other. This ultimately ended in our trip having to be cancelled because the airlines could not get all 23 passengers on a flight to our destination before the gate closed. The lack of efficiency was only second to the lack of care and empathy on the Airline's part. The customer service we experienced from American throughout this process was abysmal- agents literally laughed at a hopeless mother of six who had been stranded for two days because of their system's incompetence. We did everything in our power to ensure that we were working within the system requirements, being diligent to double or triple check things (even though that is not our job) and get to the airport 5-6 hours early to be safe. None of it mattered. In the end the Airlines failed miserably to treat us like respected customers or even with basic human decency. Because of this disaster and being stuck in Dallas for nearly 72 hours we incurred thousands of dollars in expenses (hotel rooms, Uber rides, food deliveries). We hold American responsible for this nightmare, though Qatar played their part as well. If they had not closed the gate on 23 people 30 seconds before we walked up to the gate (and refused to reopen it) none of this would have ever happened.

When we got to our second flight, there was a ground delay for another two hours. However, one of the hours was due to miscommunication with the airport staff and even though we had been ready to leave for an hour, we were waiting on staff to direct the plane who had no idea that we were ready. On my final flight to my destination there was another 45 minute delay. When the boarding time came, staff had announced that there will be another delay but they could not give us an estimated departure or arrival time. They did not even give us an explanation as to why, however another passenger later found out it was due to the crew members never arriving and no one was able to contact them. the tickets weren’t cheap and it has ended up being a waste of my money and time.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,6/1/2023,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Destin-Fort Walton Beach,Milwaukee,TRUE,United States,TRUE,Domestic

The other issue is that in prior flights on CRJ 900s, I have always been able to stow a rollaboard, which can be easily stowed above the seats the right side of this aircraft. When I asked this attendant why the policy had changed, she was rather impertinent stating that this had always been the policy by law (i.e. the need to check rollaboards). You can check your records to see how often I have flown this route from either SRQ to Charlotte or DCA and I was always allowed to bring a bag on board. I sense that my question, which was very diplomatically phrased, was not appreciated and led to the rest of our less than satisfactory interaction. I have flown American for years and prior to the pandemic was in Executive Platinum status for many of them. It is discouraging to have had a rude attendant, particularly when we paid to be in business class. It was also interesting to her how soft and welcoming her demeanor became when advertising the credit card and is associated amenities.

The planes are small so if you have a standard to large carry on, it will have to be checked in.

American Eagle,1,"""a vast contrast""","Flew American Eagle from Columbus to New York. There is a vast contrast between flying American Airlines mainline and American Eagle. American Eagle (AE) is to be avoided if you have any other option, especially if your route uses one of their old embraer or bombardier planes that insist on gate checking roll on bags, CRJ700, ERJ140 and ERJ145. American Airlines mainline are my airline of choice especially when flying internationally. I fly AE in and out of Columbus frequently to connect with the AA mainline international flights. I used to book Delta Connect (DC) flights on separate tickets to avoid AE but the DC schedules changed making that option impractical. As examples, with AE you have a 50/50 chance of arriving in Columbus and having to wait a couple of hundred yards back from the gate for about 10 minutes until the below wing ground handlers saunter out of their break room to marshall the aircraft onto stand. You can then wait an average of 15-20 minutes to have your gate checked bag delivered back to the jet bridge. DC normally do this in under 3 minutes for the same aircraft type. If you hold check a bag you better allow yourself a full 45 minutes before it will be delivered on the carousel. With any weather disruptions anywhere in the AA network they will delay and cancel the AE flights, especially the flights in and out of their 2nd tier bases, to the benefit of the mainline and hub flights. Then you will get a shrug of the shoulders from their staff and a statement that because it is weather related the airline bears no responsibility for any delays etc.. You will have about a 20% chance of a maintenance issue on any given flight with this older fleet. Normally it will take 20 minutes to fix the issue and then typically an hour to update the maintenance logbook before you journey can continue. It is unfortunate that the AE below wing operations are so bad as their above wing staff do appear to hustle and to be nice to the passengers.",Business,Premium Economy,5/1/2016,Neutral,Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,CMH,LGA,TRUE,United States,TRUE,Domestic

I changed my flight from Business Class to First Class from BKK to ORD. There was no First Class on NH808 from BKK to NRT. So, I flew Business Class and there was no food until about 1.30 before landing in NRT. Once again the flight attendants were outstanding. After arriving in NRT, I was escorted to the ANA First Class Suite lounge for the 8 next hours. Not very many people in the lounge. I was escorted to NH012 and boarded. Only 3 of us in First Class. The most outstanding flight service began. All the Flight Attendants introduced themselves. After the take-off and the meal service started. It really looked as if was going to a feast. I became quite ill and very cold. They set up my bed and gave me many blankets and I slept for about 8 hours. They constantly checked on me, which I appreciated very much. I did feel better when I woke up. We had to land in Rockford due to weather and did not get to ORD until about 6pm. I would recommend ANA Business class an First Class at any time.

The flight was punctual and everything ran smoothly. IFE was available and featured movies in English but had an extensive Japanese menu. There were no English TV shows, only Japanese TV serials. My food was awful. The main course was very small and very salty and not well presented.It was an odd mix of cold soba noodles, a sushi roll with edamame, a bun with butter and a salad, usually Japanese style potato salad with mayonnaise. They handed out a half sandwich halfway through the flight (egg salad) and drinks were offered regularly. The wine selection was dreadful and my sparkling wine undrinkable.  We were offered eye masks, toothbrushes and earplugs. Everyone had a pair of slippers and earphones in their seat. There was a blanket and pillow but the plane was too hot for use of the blanket. The staff responded promptly to calls and all requests and I was impressed with them. They are way better than SQ and gives SQ a run for its money. After a 2 hour wait in Narita, boarded the 787 for KUL. Again, a smooth journey, food offerings again small, salty and a confusing mix of Japanese and Western on a tray.

Even from the ground, the check-in process (Haneda) was seamless and it took us a mere 10 minutes for check-in and security and immigration combined. Despite the aircraft (B767 & B777) being of some age, their interiors were retrofitted with up-to-date IFE (with a huge selection of the latest movies, no lagging or dead screens), and USB & laptop charging ports. The widebody aircraft meant that overhead storage space was more than sufficient and nobody had any problems finding space for their bags.

The B777 aircraft is an older version enroute to Seoul. The food is ok, not great as I was expecting. In my opinion they should just serve the Bibimbap enroute to Seoul and something different should be served in between Seoul and Manila and Seoul to LAX. That kind of explains why they have toothbrushes and mouthwash in the lavatories. While on transit in Seoul, the seats in the boarding gates are so stiff. I looked around for better seats to rest and I couldn't find any. The room is also small that there aren't enough seats for everybody. Some passengers just stood and wait for the next flight. Upon boarding, everybody rushed in again without any order. There still is no systematic boarding, unlike China Southern, EVA Airways, Cathay Pacific and Air China.

Had window and aisle seat, large storage compartment next to window. Legroom was just average. Asiana does not offer a premium economy, but charges $100 extra for some bulkhead rows with extra legroom. Service was friendly and efficient. Korean food option was very good. Inflight entertainment was comprehensive with US, Korean and world movie/TV options. ICN to Beijing leg was scheduled to be an A330, but they substituted an A321 that was only half full. Two hour flight departed and arrived on-time. It was uneventful, and was served a breakfast with a choice of western or Chinese food. The return from Shanghai Pudong was on a packed new A350. Seating was 3-3-3 and the first 4 or 5 rows in economy had a couple of extra inches of legroom, for $150 extra. Since it was less than a 2 hour flight I chose not to pay extra. The A350 had seatback entertainment system with a full compliment of movies and TV from both US and Asian sources. We were served a warm lunch, again with western or Asian food choices. We stayed over for 2 nights in Seoul before returning to LA on Asiana flight 204. Check-in at Incheon went very smoothly, using a self check terminal to generate a boarding pass and then dropping our bags. At bag check, the Asiana clerk gave us a pass to use expedited customs clearance. It was very short line, and customs and security took less than 5 minutes. The Seoul to LA leg was again in an A380. This time we sat in the main cabin which is 3-4-3 arrangement. We chose the centre section, so you are only 1 seat away from the aisle.

When I landed in Tirana, neither of my checked luggages came with me. The smaller luggage came after 2 days, one of the checked bags came after 3 days and the other big luggage still missing after 1 week.  So, half of my daughter's clothes, all the supplements and anti-pyretics I got in case my daughter got sick during our trip, and all of my clothing and shoes, altogether with some gifts I got for the people we were going to visit, lost in that luggage. They tell me to send the receipts for the replacement items. What about all I spent to get the luggage and what I have in it? What about all the frustration and the wasted time to find clothes for us when we could be enjoying our vacation as we were supposed to? Our vacation was ruined and all what Austrian airlines customer support tells you is to file the missing luggage report online and the replacement items form online and that's all. The seats were so tight that you had no room for the arms. The meal was horrible.  At least the coffee was good. I had to remind the flight attendants to give my daughter the crackers and the meal she was entitled to, even though she had her own seat paid at full price.

Breeze Airways,4,"""fail miserably on the reimbursement process""","I have flown Breeze several times and was beginning to enjoy their airline. Then flying back from Las Vegas my plane arrived at the gate on time. Then they had some kind of issue with how the plane was docked at the gate. They tried for a couple of hours to fix it. They boarded us. Then they had software problems, or something. Then after a couple of hours they had us get off the plane because it was getting too hot in the Las Vegas summer sun. Who knew Las Vegas gets hot in the Summer? Apparently not Breeze. After a few more hours they decided they could not get the plane fixed or cooled down and sent all of the passengers away saying that you could either rebook on another airline (although there really weren't more than a couple of expensive seats on those other airlines) or get a hotel room on Breeze for the night. That's where the problems begin again.  I got a room at a nearby Holiday Inn Express, nothing lavish. Cost ~$135. After I book the room Breeze sends an email and says you only have 6 days to apply for a hotel reimbursement and $20 for one meal. My total very inexpensive meals were ~$80 for dinner and breakfast. Plus an UBER back and forth to the airport. Breeze  so far has only reimbursed me $20 and if I accept that payment I must click on an agreement that binds me to that settlement. They are all talk at the airport about how great they will be, and then they fail miserably on the reimbursement process.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,6/1/2023,Very Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Neutral,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Las Vegas,Charleston,TRUE,United States,TRUE,Domestic

Breeze Airways,1,"""they don’t deserve one penny of your money""","This is the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. I saw a poster for Breeze in the Provo airport. I have flown on Allegiant many times between Provo and Phoenix for work, but no flight was available on my desired day of travel so I decided to give them a try. The actual flight was fine, on time, very clean new plane, no bells and whistles but I didn’t expect any, even though I paid $200 for a one way ticket including paying for my checked bag. And here becomes the issue. I spent over an hour in Phoenix baggage claim and my suitcase never showed up. Happens, right? Not like this. There is no one at a ticket counter, no one in baggage claim, NO ONE TO CALL. That’s right, they do not speak to their passengers by phone. My options to locate my bag were text, email or Facebook messenger (seriously). I would never have flown an airline that doesn’t provide customer service by phone had I known. I sent an email and text only to receive an automatic reply to please allow up to TWO WEEKS for a response. WHAT? I paid to check this bag and they lost it after an hour long flight and now I can’t contact anyone to find it. It’s so upsetting and appalling. As I began to inventory the lost items my panic, frustration and nausea grew. I have sent messages daily for the last five days, finally received an email with a lost bag claim number, no apology, no recourse, the email said I could text to ask about reimbursement to the number I already texted with no response. How can a business treat its customers like this? I don’t get it. I have worked in hospitality for 25+ years and this is just dumbfounding. What about brand loyalty? Repeat customers? Not if they don’t care enough to have someone answer the phone when losing their personal property! The worst part, staff in the departing, arrival and flight continuing airports have all told me that this happens all the time. They see people wander around baggage claim and then begin to realize their bags are gone and there’s no one to talk to, no one who cares. I’ve had substantially better treatment from the airport information desk than the airline I paid to entrust with my bag. Don’t fly this airline.

Luggage receipts sent three days to the Breeze telephone number they gave me to use. It was six weeks yesterday, I haven't received one penny of my money spent on clothes/toiletries. I have sent numerous messages to the ""one number"" they gave me to communicate with. They replied once and said they would review the receipts and get back to me within four weeks. It had been over six weeks and they stopped replying to me. They now send an autogenerated response that says thankyou for sending your receipts. There is no way to have human contact and their website doesn't provide any further info either. By the way, they don't have a way to provide reviews either.

No communication at all. The gate agents would not talk to anyone and they weren’t even present at the desk. Extremely rude anytime someone tried to ask why they wouldn’t communicate with passengers. They very clearly didn’t work for breeze, they were probably cheap contractors that clearly didn’t give a damn about any of us. After hours and hours a gate agent finally announced on the intercom that she would provide an update to concerned travelers within a couple minutes. Hours passed by without any updates. When it was time to board they began a roll call which was very confusing and they gave no information as to why they had to do a roll call. Almost 9 hours late the flight left LAX. People on the plane were having panic attacks and no information was being provided to calm passengers down. People started asking to get off the plane and they were told they couldn’t get off even though the cabin was overheating. Finally, once at the destination Breeze just “lost” all the bags.

I didn't rush to get ready, due to the extra time I had. I was an hour away from the airport and about an hour and a half before my flight I received another message saying my flight was leaving on time. I scheduled my Uber and went to the airport. I tried to check in through the app but was told I couldn't and would need to check in at the counter. Everything I could find on the Breeze app told me to go to Terminal B. My Uber driver said Breeze was normally Terminal A buy took me to B at my request. I got there and found out I did need to walk to Terminal A which was very long with my luggage. When I arrived, they told me I was 15 minutes too early to check in. I waited, checked in and got my boarding pass with no issue but they weren't very friendly. Once I made it to the gate, we were supposed to depart at 4:50. We didn't start boarding until 4:50 and were never given a reason for the delay. When we started boarding, it wasn't the plane we booked. It was much smaller, no first class or extra leg room seating. We just sat wherever we could. The pilot finally came on and told us our plane had been damaged by the ground crew. To apologize, they gave everyone free drinks and snacks. When we landed in Tulsa, we sat at the gate for 20 minutes before being told it was broken and we were moving to a different gate. During my trip, I wanted to add another ticket to my return flight. The ticket was for a child so the app wouldn't let me but it on its own. There is no customer service so I followed the FAQs. It told me how to add a child ticket and I tried to follow the step by step directions but the app didn't do what the FAQs said it would do. Facebook messenger customer service finally told me that I needed to cancel my flight and rebook them together. My ticket don't, not the child's, would double in price.

Breeze Airways,1,"""This airline is a nightmare""","This airline is a nightmare. They advertise to be “Tech first” leading with technology. This means no person on the other end of the phone - actually there is NO ONE for customers to call. They actually give you a number to text that NO ONE responds to. And yes, it was the correct number. It prompted me to respond ‘Help’ for assistance. I responded help 6 different times over 4 hours with no response at all. This prompted me to arrive at the airport early. The desk attendant proceeded to tell me that they get priority response which is why I didn’t get a response. So unless you’re already at the airport, forget about getting any assistance. They had a scheduling conflict and delayed my first flight leg to Virginia which would have caused me to miss my connecting Breeze flight on the second leg. I had less than 12hrs notice, and when I got to the airport they refused to hold the connecting flight, said they couldn’t get me on another flight or route that day, and refused to get me on another airline. In fact, they suggested i go to Virginia and get a refund for the rest of the flight. Guess I’m just going to stay in Virginia? Absolutely useless, Incompetent and free of responsibility for messing up your trip. I’m fact, they left me no choice but to cancel my flight and rebook myself with another airline at a loss of hundreds of dollars. They said because I ‘canceled’ I wouldn’t receive any extra points for the inconvenience when they’re the ones that caused this whole situation. I’m never been so displeased with an airline and will never fly with them again or recommend them. Especially if you are planning to be somewhere important.

But this AM, trying to return, same problem. Cannot checkin on line - tried a dozen times starting yesterday within the 24 hour window specified by the website.

Nope, no Boarding Pass. Sorry, you're out of luck. I spend another $300 for a flight on a different ""real"" airline for later the same day, get my boarding pass within minutes, online, mind you and get thru TSA. I march to the Breeze counter where I'm actually told that I don't need a Boarding Pass. They told me I don't need a Boarding Pass to get thru Security / TSA screening. Since when? And, and if that's the case, wouldn't it have been really helpful for someone at the Check In Desk to mention that to me when it would have mattered instead of saying ""Sorry, we can't do anything - like print your boarding pass for you"". I found this experience to be one of if not the most infuriating travel experiences in a lifetime (25 years) of mostly decent treatment by airlines, hotels and travel companies. Breeze is worse than any other discount airline you can think of.  This will be my one and only Breeze interaction and I Still can't believe that TSA will let anyone in Charleston thru with just a Driver's License.

But what I really like is that upgrading to their Nicest cabin with a first class seat is very reasonable - maybe $100 each way. The ability to fly nonstop and in comfort makes Breeze a winning proposition. There are some things they could do better - there's no wifi or IFE on the plane, and the flights only run twice a week, so it's not always possible to use Breeze if your schedule doesn't match up.

The boarding process was very easy and go the seat with no problem. If you are a bigger person, you may need a seat belt extender. Just ask the flight crew right when you step on and they will give you one before heading to the seat. Once boarded the captain came out and spoke with the cabin and explained the flight. We took off on time and landed 20 minutes early. The fight was very smooth and couldn't have been happier. There are inflight refreshments but unless you are in the Nicest seats cost money. I flew back to Tampa in the Nicest seats and WOW! what an upgrade. For an extra fifty bucks having the extra width and leg room was fantastic. I sat in row 1 which provide extra leg room and at 6'4'' was more room then really needed. The seats are comfortable and have a reclining feature with a foot/ leg rest. Inflight refreshments come with the seat which include a can of soda and other beverages and snacks. The snacks are not the little airplane snacks but large bags of chips, candy, and energy bars. Overall, the staff was fantastic. The inflight stewards were professional and very nice and accommodating. The gate staff were also professional and prompt to load flights and get people on. The only things to remember: No in free inflight refreshments. Depending on your seat you will be allowed a personal item, carry on, or loaded bag. Some seats only allow a small personal item, and a carry-on bag will cost extra. Also I think the reviews related to delay flight and issues relate to a very limited number of aircraft. I was the only Breeze flight at the terminal, of the flight was cancelled there would be no other alternative, so there is a inherent risk you are taking.

Now it is the day before we leave and I was just notified that our outgoing flight tomorrow has been delayed 5 hours! Now we will miss lunch and our apt for manicures and pedicures tomorrow. When you have such a short trip planned it is incredibly frustrating when the airlines basically take an entire day off your trip and you have to cancel plans.

Breeze is labelled as terminal 1 but once you’re in the terminal there’s no direction to actually get to your gate (my app and boarding pass said TBD for the gate far after I talked to people to figure it out). Let me give you a hint, you have to walk a ways to find a tram that takes you to another gate. You should talk to someone because there’s no labelling. Flight was delayed two hours to depart at 10 instead of 8. I’m not mad about that part. Everyone was at the gate waiting and about 10 minutes after boarding was suppose to start they said the flight was delayed for another two hours. Four hours total! We weren’t given any reason and one person said this was unacceptable so they said over the intercom they’d call law enforcement to the gate if needed. Grow up.

Breeze Airways,9,"""Seats comfortable. Staff friendly""","I was skeptical of this airlines because of how new it was and seemed to be getting so-so reviews. So after taking my flight I felt the need to leave a review to help add another viewpoint to the system. Overall I would rate the experience 4.8 out of 5 stars, but have no problem giving them 5. I flew myself and my family, a total of 3 people, from Orlando, FL to our state home, non-stop, for under $450. This was in the start of spring break for many places and most tickets were 300-$400/person for other flights. Prices for Breeze did go up as the flight day came closer, but stayed under $150/person by the day of the flight. Any other airlines would have been significantly more expensive and had a connection flight, taking longer to get us home. The process on the app is fairly simple and making changes is easy as well. The first issue I had was the app can be a bit slow to update your gate location if it doesn’t have one yet. On the day of the flight we figured out what gate we needed to go to through google flights before the app informed us of the location. It did tell us well in advance though, about an hour out from boarding. It was fairly simple to find the main desks at the airport, but usually no one will be there until at least 2 hours prior to the flight, or at least that’s the case at MCO. Our flight was slightly delayed l, but that was because something delayed it before it arrived in Orlando, so it was just the domino effect. They did do their best to get things caught up, which only had us delayed by 10 min in the end. Boarding went fairly quick and we were quick to get up in the air. One of the captains actually grabbed the intercom that the flight attendants use and updated everyone on the status of everything while in plain view, before departing. I appreciated that personalized address, instead of the standard, locked in the cabin and talking to you from behind closed doors. During the flight, like most budget airlines, every snack and item will cost something. One surprise though is that entertainment is complimentary on our flight, but you’ll have to use your own device. You simply log in to their onboard Wi-Fi and select the “free” option which takes you to their website that offers a variety of movies, shows, and games at no charge. If you want more internet access options you’ll have to pay for upgraded internet. The seats were actually very comfortable for a budget flight. I upgraded us to extra leg room, or basically the first class seats for $30/seat. The seats just behind those though also looked similarly comfortable, but I did not look at the seats further back and don’t know if they’re the same or different the further back you go. Landing went smoothly and my checked baggage was delivered to baggage claim fairly quickly and didn’t have the appearance of being thrown in the ring with a wild bull, like some I’ve seen in the past with other airlines. In the end, I spent a total of $440 and that included 3 selected seats at $30/ea and one checked bag for $35. Flight for 3 people was about $169 and fees were around $146. Overall, I was happy with the airlines and will very likely use them again. Hopefully the experience will continue to be the same.

When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing them with ""my issues"". I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked. Overall my experience with British Airlines has been the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with. I will never book with this company again.

British Airways,1,"""cancel your flight without notice""","Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again.

I think I speak for many when I say my expectations are always low when it comes to airlines food. Gone are the days when you use to get decent meals on the air whilst traveling. So I really wasn't expecting much. Just a whatever meal until I get to my destination. Well to my disappointment, on all of my transits flights I was only served one vegan meal, that is unacceptable. On the Atlanta flight to Frankfurt, I was served rice with a few vegetables for dinner, which was fine, no complaints there. Then comes breakfast time, everybody was given their whatever meal and I was told that they only have an apple for me, ""the flight attendance exact words to me were, ""well you a vegan right, I can only give you the apple."" I respectfully said no thank you to her. Everybody else was given their whatever meal which was a sandwich, yogurt and an apple. My flight from Brussels to Banjul, again I was served some nasty looking what looked like beans with some red sauce over couscous and that was all I got. For breakfast, they gave me and everyone else a big waffle which I didn't eat because I suspected there might be eggs in it. These airlines should do better in the ways they treat people.  I went online and booked my ticket to fit my travel needs and at a price that was affordable to me. So when I tell you am a vegan, you should make the proper accommodations for me, this was a very long journey with very short transit time.

Tried to pay for two extra bags online one way only for presents. Should have been $154 each with discount online, but they charged $200 each. Then the computer had a glitch and an email showed one extra bag to Uganda and two coming back. But the website confirmed four bags - two extra to Uganda. Computer was flawed because the three bags shown in the email would have cost $554 instead of the $400 paid. Called Brussels Airlines in Brussels and they confirmed there were four bags (two extra) Washington to Uganda on the website but this later disappeared. Brussels Air manager in Dulles said computer no longer showed either of the two extra bags Washington to Brussels to Uganda. He said pay another $400 and they would refund. But they didn't refund and wouldn't answer inquiries about the claim several weeks later. Then they lost the bags in Brussels for two days and failed to track them on the computer when found. The Dulles baggage agent said Brussels Air is the worst handling baggage and might lose them for a week or two. I called Brussels again and found they were on their way to Uganda. Six hours after my call they were still shown as lost on the computer. Bags came a day late and we had to pay a taxi $200 to transfer them across the country to our destination. On return the Brussels - Washington trip was cancelled at the last minute after departure from Entebbe and they tried to send us through Frankfurt instead of switching to United/Brussels to DC. We complained and they permitted the United flight. But we had paid for economy plus and United didn't respect that so we had to pay again. We put in a claim on the day of departure from DC for the double charge on excess baggage but they didn't respond, and when we called after some weeks still didn't respond in spite of promises by the phone rep. They also didn't respond to a request to refund the economy plus fee for the cancelled flight Brussels to Washington, even though the replacement airline (United) didn't recognize the payment to them and charged it again. Their airport reps were friendly and helpful but the Brussels organization is extremely inefficient. They still use the bankrupt Sabena identifier SN.

When I finally spoke to someone they told me I would have to come back after signing a missing baggage claim and that I should call the number given or they would call me. Until this time no one has reached out to me. I call the airport and was transferred to the airline representative and was hung up on twice. After that I called back and with told by the front desk of the airport that they would have to call me and tell me what to do. I waited 2 hours after coming off the airline to be told that my bag (car seat) was maybe not here. This is an inconvenience because after having a delayed flight and a hungry child for almost the whole day. Had to let my one handed mother in law hold my child until we got to Kingston. The representatives were not at all helpful had to wait 2 hours to be told that the car seat was maybe left in New York. No reassurance or outline of how I would receive anything.

Caribbean Airlines,1,"""wonderful service they provide""","New York JFK to Montego Bay. Caribbean Airlines made arrangements for a wheelchair at the airports going and returning. At JFK, we arrived early and were checked in immediately and they had the wheelchair right as I checked in. Then we were taken to lounge followed by taking us to the gate. We sat in 3c and 3f. Very nice seats. Because of the freezing temps that morning, we had a slight delight because of possible fuel line link but the pilot played it safe. After about an hour we were cleared to leave. As I had previously ordered our meals, we enjoyed a cheese omelet and delicious fish cakes, the best rum punch and best coffee ever. The economy class had the cheese omelet also. The movie shown was Mr. Church, a relatively new movie. Excellent flight with a wheelchair waiting at the gate. Crew was just terrific. Our return flight was on March 18 and again, terrific check in, quick and easy. Wheelchair waiting for me at check in. We sat in the same seats on the returning flight. Dinner was chicken and poached salmon, although they ran out of the key lime pie, we had delicious grilled fruit with a mango salsa, a rum punch, excellent coffee and a Hennessy brandy. Ecomony had sandwiches that night, I believe it was ham and cheese but not sure . The movie shown was Dr. Strange, unfortunately the tv screen wasn't working well, this happens. Crew was good but we got spoiled by the crew on the 11th. Again the wheelchair was waiting for us at the gate and since we have global entry, we were out within 15 minutes. Luggage was out first both in Montego Bay and JFK. We have taken Caribbean Airlines for a number of years and only once had an issue with crew, which was years ago.

Cathay Pacific Airways,1,"""It has been a nightmare""","Paid extra for a good seat; Didn't get it due to weight balance but was promised refund the price difference before the flight; Wasted 10+ hours in nightmares with the Cathay Pacific customer service on whatsapp, emails, and phone calls, but it's still not resolved yet. I spent a few hundred dollars more on this 17 hour long trip, for a seat with good leg room and unobstructed view by the wing. However, I was told by the lady at the check-in counter that the seat had been changed by ""the people in Hong Kong"" for weight balance and she could do nothing about it. But she told me that the price difference can be refunded as long as I contact the customer service. And I believed her easily and thought that would be easy and not waste much of my time, because the fact that a paid service cannot be provided implies that that part of the cost should refunded. Or so I thought. The first customer service guy told me that it was impossible even before I could finish describing my situation. And he was also very ignorant of what services they are offering, and thought that one doesn't have to pay anything for extra leg room nowadays. I contacted again in emails, and the second person turned out to be a huge disappointment too. I was humiliated by a ""goodwill gesture"" of 10,000 Asia Miles that I will probably never use. And this guy even started to blame that it was their staff at JFK who changed my seat, which contradicted what I heard before the flight. And I am confused why that can be a good reason for not refunding me too, maybe by discrediting the check-in counter lady who told me that I could easily get a refund? After that I have spent more hours on emails and phone calls with their customer service. It has been a nightmare. More appointment and more humiliation. This is my first flight with Cathay Pacific, and I think the last one too. I don't know why it was a trustworthy airline in my impression, but not anymore. Regarding the inflight experience, I had a broken TV, a tiny unstable table with no beverage holder, and was in a location directly facing the toilet.

Cathay Pacific Airways,1,"""many touch points missed""","Los Angeles to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Travel is a gift. Every touch point should evoke a different sense of excitement and thrill. Air flights are the beginnings of many touch points, and options for comfort exist. International business class is not all equal. Here's my optic of Cathay Pacific Business Class LAX-HKG-BKK and the return BKK-HKG-LAX. How excited we were to by chance be able to save our vacation travel from headaches and fly Cathay Pacific. Originally, we were set to fly PAL Business Class thru Manila to BKK; however, the Taal Volcano threw us a curve ball four days before our journey was to begin. In desperately search for an alternative carrier that would align with existing connections in BKK as well as return accommodation in BKK, Cathay Pacific held the flights. Without hesitation we booked. Now, we are not novices to International Business Class travel. EVA is our most preferred carrier, but its flight schedule did not align with our awaiting connection in BKK. We had always said that we should fly Cathay Pacific to see how it compared. It was only just nine months earlier we flew PAL for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. With that being said, we were under impression that Cathay Pacific held one up on EVA. So, perhaps Cathay Pacific would be our new go to first before EVA. Let us begin. Flight CX881 15 Jan 20 LAX-HKG departed on time. That's always a good thing. The business seat though lacks lumbar support (see photo). The amenity kit was marginally stocked with a toothbrush kit, 15ml mouthwash, Bamford hand cream plus lip balm as well as hydrating face spray, sleep mask, and earplugs. Other marginal amenities were a pair of small disposal slippers that are not quite sized to accommodate a wide foot market and a comforter. No pajamas here folks on this long haul as EVA, but to be fair PAL lacks PJs as well. Good thing though I brought a heavy cotton sweater as the cabin is kept cold, like cold cold. You learn these little things as you travel. Not all carriers maintain comfortable air. Movie selection at first appears to be vast, but upon further review, Maleficent was the only recent movie. I'm not on top of trending movies, so I named Maleficent due to TV commercial exposure. The rest are older releases with some that are ancient. Ah, not something expected. Please take time to learn what customers are seeing at the movies. A note about the interactive monitor, it is sluggish to the point of freezing up at times while scrolling. What type of dated software operating system is being used? Just saying. The dinner options were typical. Local food with some Western. When the flight attendant came to take my dinner order, she asked if I would like the burger. She then asked if I would like the seared chicken breast. That received a no. She actually looks stunned and finally asked what I would like. I ordered fish ball tung choy choy soup. For beverages, I ordered French Burgundy and water. BTW, no flight attendant comes around asking if you would like more wine.  Dessert taken was cheese along with fruit, and I asked for a cordial Cointreau. Another look of like OMG I have to work. With the flight leaving almost at midnight, there was no pre cordial anything which was not expected either. So many touch points missed.

When they did open, they did not answer the phone -- we were on hold for 2 hours 13 minutes before some Tool picked up to inform me that, because we failed to present ourselves, China Air was imposing a $150 per ticket fee to release the tickets. After over an hour and the usual escalation, the Tool gave me a phone number and email address to which JetBlue must present evidence that their flight was late so they'd release the tickets graciously without the fee, like any normal airline would any day. So, after 15 hours on nearly continuous phone calls in the airport, we got clearance to rebook, and Jet Blue put us on Cathay Pacific. Returning home, we checked our bags through to Orlando, knowing we'd have to clear customs & recheck them in NY.

China Eastern Airlines,8,"""good food and service""","Hong Hong to Budapest via Shanghai. Flew on A320 on HKG to Shanghai while in a newer B787-9 on the long haul to Budapest. China Eastern marketed flights. The long haul leg was flown by their daughter company Shanghai Airlines to Budapest. Amazing experience, pure adventure. Bought this ticket some months earlier for the high season to Europe as a huge bargain for 347 USD including 2 x 23 kg of luggage which is welcomed near X-mas. It costed me in addition positioning and depositioning flights to which I volunteered as I needed the extra miles for my elite status. However, I was notified (2 months before travel) by my online travel agent (Travelgenio), that the return flight from Budapest was preponed by 1 hour. Then, I was forced to change as I would not be able to arrive in time for the new departure. I then decided to change plans completely and celebrate New Year in Budapest instead of Vietnam. Thus, I postponed my return travel from Budapest by 3 days. This was done by emails to the Travel Agent (no response) and then phone calls to Ch. Eastern in Brisbane and Shanghai. Eventually, it went smoothly and I was changed to my wish without added costs (apart from changing onward flights beyond Hong Kong with another airline). That even allowed me to do another, cheap detour to Hanoi on my way back to Hue. The homepages of China Eastern and Shanghai are difficult to penetrate and to book or change bookings from. Unless one has a Chinese telephone number. However, 10 days before departure I could access seating and chose freely my favourite seats, even got 1 of 4 legs in exit seat. However, one cannot access the entire booking unless registered with CE’s flyer program in which I am not interested. Apart from that it was a good adventure: a complicated travel where everything could have gone wrong, but all went smooth. Arrived in Hongkong early and was able to check-in 6 hours before departure as the airline have many departures daily. No queues at the check-in and the ground staff were good and answered questions though fearing speaking English. Two BPs issued immediately. Flying HKG-PVG is considered as international flights though it could be considered as domestic. That give the advantage of not leaving transit while leaving HKG and passing PVG. First flight was on an aged A320. Extremely controlled and organised priority boarding at gate where all business and elite flyers were boarding entirely before the remaining passengers. Onboard, newspapers and 10 channels of music were offered (bring own headset). Shared monitors showed some educational movies. Food was limited to a tidy pack of biscuits. Drinks were unlimited (water, tea, coffee, beers), but only for 1 hour out of the 2½ hour long flight: during ascend and descend all services were closed down until 40 Minutes after kick-off and again 40 Minutes before landing. That leaves passengers with very limited time of service. FAs were fine. The second flight were by Shanghai Airlines’ Dreamliner. It was a very positive surprise and was faultless. Modern aircraft, good food and service, 2 hot meals offered at dinner and then again at breakfast. Frequent drink rounds. Button calls answered quickly and needs were addressed instantly. Individual IFE on touchscreen monitors was very easy and quick to operate with a good number of Western and English translated movies. Toilets clean.

I stood there for over 1 hr. Finally, I asked my traveling agent to book me with the different airline at the same day or tomorrow flight. When I asked the supervisor to do in writing that they refused to issue me my boarding pass and the reason, she came out later and told me that she can now help me correct the name on ticket to be exactly same as the passport.

China Eastern Airlines,8,"""all pleasant throughout""","Honolulu to Hong Kong via Shanghai. My wife and I took a chance on our last trip to Asia and flew on China Eastern Airlines. The fare for the flights we chose on them were a few hundred dollars lower than what we were finding on more traditional Asian carriers. We booked our ticket through a third party platform (Justfly) in early October for a November 1 departure from Honolulu to Hong Kong via Shanghai. One thing that you will find out quick is that when you book your ticket through a third party, you are not able to then go back to the airlines website and check on the booking until the day before departure. You also cannot choose seats until, literally, you get to the airport and check in at the kiosk. This made us wonder if the booking ever happened. I even worked with Justfly to confirm and looked at my Credit Card bill in which China Eastern was indeed paid the money for the booking we made. So as far as I was concerned, on the day we left, there would be a booking. On that day, we went to the airport just a little earlier than normal to be sure that if there were any problems whatsoever, we could deal with them in time for the flight. What pleased me was that the booking was indeed in the system, our seats chosen and we could even change our seats right there. Another concern I had from reviews on this and other sites said that the bags would not be checked through to our final destination, meaning that when we got to Shanghai we would need to exit the airport, get our bags and re-check them into our Hong Kong flight. We were pleased that this was not the case and indeed, the bags were tagged for Hong Kong and, indeed, hours later upon arrival we saw our bags on the carousel there. Service on the flight was good. Coach class food that was served was perfectly fine. They did serve red wine on the flight and we enjoyed a variety of good food throughout the service to Shanghai, and then to Hong Kong. Keep in mind that the most safe food that one can eat is the food that is served on an airplane, so unless you are allergic to some ingredient that they use, you will find the food quite applicable and satisfactory. Later on when I was walking the cabin I noted a small bar in the galley that one could get a drink and a bag of peanuts. Aircraft was clean and seemed neatly taken care of, One thing that a passenger of a healthy girth may need to know is that the seat belts don't make it all the way. You will need to ask for a extender, which the crew happily gives upon request. The attendants spoke English as well as Chinese, and were all pleasant throughout the service we experienced. With more ""effervescent"" passengers, they still acted professional and held to standards at all times. The entertainment system at each seat had a decent variety of movies and the flight tracking program was as good as ones I have seen on American or Delta. Transfers at Shanghai for passengers going on another China Southern or Shanghai Airlines flight (the airlines are one in the same with Shanghai being the more ""basic transportation"" airline) are very straightforward, Just follow the signs to the transfer desk and go through security. Be sure to take out any electronic devices including power chargers for your phone - have them go through the X-ray without pulling out and most likely the security people will take the device from you with some excuse saying that it was too large or not applicable.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,11/1/2018,Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Satisfied,Dissatisfied,Honolulu,Hong Kong,TRUE,Hong Kong,FALSE,International

Even when the booking company called Condor directly, which Condor said was the only way changes or seat selection could be made, Condor still said no.  I booked Premium Economy and then paid $50 on my personal credit card for my seat. The ticket itself was paid for by my company, I had to pay for the seat with my personal credit card. Then, 3 days before the flight, Condor changed planes and the new plane didn't have Premium Economy. Not sold out, but the new plane didn't have those seats at all and no refund for the $50 for my seat selection. My wife was traveling with me, she purchased her ticket directly from Condor, and no seat even though she paid $50 as well. My wife is vegan and selected a vegan meal. But  we are now on the plane in economy, and no vegan meal for her. She is allergic to dairy so her Vegan meal is not a choice, but a medical condition. Her ticket says Vegan meal, when she signs on to the app it says Vegan Meal, but when the Attendant looks at her list, there is no Vegan Meal.

This goes for a lot of their ground crew on their seasonal routes I suppose because they are part time and being trained in a short period. In one instance the counter person attached my bag claim sticker to my luggage, I pointed it out and he apologized. It's obvious they need to sharpen their skills. The only thing I can say is that they got me to where I was going, and was fed well. As far as comfort? I would be better off in cargo. But no denying they are the cheapest.

They cannot help but increase business and if management were more attentive to all aspects of service then there would be benefits all around. Unlikely to happen in a quasi monopoly. Further to this comment I can add that linking through the bigger airports in Brazil with higher traffic will get you a more modern aircraft or at least a seat that will go (almost) flat. Do not choose Brazilia to go to Panama if you are coming from another province: until now it will be the limited recliner at an exorbitant cost.

There was much confusion and delay in updating the screens of letting the passengers know, they didn't have any satisfying or complete answers concerning any of us being able to get help in Panama with our missed layover to LAX. The flight crew in the cabin did admirably and only gave other passengers seemingly trivial problems. From Panama City to LAX, we had to wait hours after flying in to Panama before even knowing if we'd have flights or where people would be going before reaching their destination. The ground service was laughable, it was one man trying his best albeit not even close to being able to handle the situation with another service member focused on the next flight for the area & sometimes both of them were preoccupied with making announcements or just repeating details to passengers instead of helping us with our issue of being delayed, take that as you will. Others were upset that they would not even adhere to their policies and just intended to let people out to dry due to delays. They were not taking any responsibility for the situation, would not put people up in hotels anymore or give them shuttles or any similar accommodation because as I was told, this was ceased since Covid and that's part of their new restrictions (Allow people to just congest the airport due to delays while also having all over the airport you can't sit or lay down on carpet due to Covid Safety Guidelines) It was so contradicting and beyond that they charged for wifi past 30m unless you paid to stay in an overpriced lounge for 8 hours that I heard from a lady you couldn't even sleep in and they'd keep waking you up to prevent it. Those last two parts are more on the airport than airline but the entire thing was a grossly obvious shakedown. Copa is just aiding and abetting by stranding passengers there instead of helping them. All that being considered, after waiting for hours, I talked to a man that while he gave me questionable reasons for why they couldn't do much and aren't responsible nor had anything else to do than the bare minimum, I was not worried about these other issues as much, I was quite happy he was able to give me a boarding pass for the following morning for my next 2 connections ( I was going from SJO to Panama City to LAX and had my last layover there before finally one additional flight that was with another airline fortunately! ) and he checked all the other flights at my behest to see if I could find something faster or more reasonable. There wasn't but I appreciated the effort and in the SPECIFIC time frame I was talking to him, the speed of getting me what I needed and answering my questions, though I was prepared. All in all, they acted in a way that the idea of a delay was foreign to them, they didn't have any standard procedures to handle it, they had NO sufficient answers and generally no answers to your questions unless you knew what to ask. Be it about luggage, flights, where to stay or what to do. They gave no thought to our situation besides getting us on the next available flight. In my case I had been up for a very long time and was hellbent on getting to the US so I didn't have much in terms of complaints and found the bare minimum acceptable in my case but I sympathized with all the others that got completely f'd over.

The bad part is: I can only use it here in America or in South American countries, otherwise I lose my money. I called them, explained I can't use it in America because COPA does not do domestic flights, and I can't go to any South American country because I'm right at the moment of transferring universities and as an international student holding a visa I don't know how my situation will be next semester to go during summer break! And since I study full time, summer break is the only time I would be able to go. If they know all of that and don't do anything, I feel very disrespected. I couldn't choose to not get covid and not see my family for longer than 2 years. And I can't just choose to go to Brazil to spend their tickets.

I went to eat something and came back in an hour, and the plane was gone and the terminal empty. At the Delta desk, I was told it had gone. They said other people missed it as well. Of course, they had announced the flight over the intercom and sent passengers an email, but where I was told it would be ""at least"" an hour, I ate without listening to the many constant announcements or checking my phone. Delta booked me on standby for a flight late that night, but unfortunately did not inform me that it was an overbooked flight. There was no room on that flight. I had to travel late and stay the night in a nearby town and wake up the next morning for another flight, traveling on little sleep. I had to reschedule one of the most exciting meetings of my life with a new mentor. We met that night much more briefly, with me totally frazzled and stressed. So essentially, I spent extra money on food and transportation, lost sleep, missed work, wasted many hours, had to travel late and stay overnight, had a panic attack in the empty terminal, and missed a once-in-a-lifetime meeting with a hero and new mentor of mine.

Delta Air Lines,1,"""informed the carrier was too large""","I was required to check in at the counter day of (traveling w/ pet). I made sure to buy my ticket in person ($600 one way) over the phone to make sure every requirement was met. Avoid this airline if you are a woman traveling alone, are traveling with a pet or have a fishing vacation and plan to travel with your rod and reel.  Although I bought an ""airline approved pet carrier"" and checked and rechecked dimensions (experienced with a tape measure) I was informed the carrier was too large and I would need to buy one there (unsure of mark up but willing to pay whatever the cost). I was kept at the counter a long time while the agent and her supervisor searched for a carrier to sell me. They were out and told me I would need to book a later flight while they obtained one. This was not an option because my son was already in Utah. I called my daughter back to the airport to take my cat to my ex as she is unable to keep him. Returned to the counter where the supervisor loudly told the ticket agent to find out what I had ""done""with the cat. I checked two bags one being my son's camping gear where the supervisor informed the ticket agent that my sons rod and reel couldn't be in his pack and security would determine if I could carry it with me. It was only a $100 rod but had tremendous sentimental value. Security said it was fine and people take fishing trips with their gear. I made it to the gate (I was over 2 hours early) after it had already boarded and the supervisor met me there to inform me that she herself would not allow me to board with the rod. I put the rod in garbage can (she continued to argue for a later flight while they ""obtained"" another carrier). All together this 4 hour one way economy flight cost me around $1200 and I was made to choose between my son and my best friend of over 8 years. I can't tell you the trauma this has caused me because this woman was desperate for whatever mark up or commission she got from that carrier. I miss my cat all day everyday. You can save a lot of money choosing a different airline and worst case scenario you receive comparable service.

A glorified bus ride. What’s more upsetting is the whole “going green” charade to cut cost on elements that are so fundamental to the passenger such as food. They provide meals with this sort of pre-packaged configuration where you get useless wood silverware that makes eating completely difficult. Lack of trays makes eating a super annoying task.

Lastly, they failed to deliver every bag for passengers on the leg from CAI to LOS as they only loaded bags for passengers who flew that same route the day before.

When I arrived I observed a chaotic situation without any social distancing and barely any resemblance to crowd control or customer service. There were many passengers that did not have their Covid-19 negative verification certificate printed out. Because we are in the digital age I can understand why passengers would assume that they would be able to just show an agent digital results on a mobile device. The agents were requiring passengers with their results on digital devices to print them there at the counter, Egyptair had a single laptop with a malfunctioning printer at a counter that all of the passengers had to share. Again, there was not any social distancing, no hand sanitizer, no assistance for passengers who were not computer literate and the male ticket agents had extremely bad attitudes. This created a situation of chaos. As a result of all of the chaos, some passengers missed the closing of the boarding gate including myself. I was told that I would not be able to board the flight and I was offered to have the flight rebooked for free. The gentleman at the counter told me that I would not have to pay a change fee. When I got to the counter to arrange for a new flight the attendant who was making arrangements for other passengers was charging what he called an upgrade fee. I watched him as he did this to three different passengers, with each of the fees being different for each passenger sitting in the same section. It was now my turn. He told me that I had to pay a fee. I asked, ""What is the fee for"". He said that it was upgrading the service. I then asked him what are the upgrades and what do I get. He looked surprised that I asked that question and had no explanation for it. I then asked him will I be getting something extra and will I be able to pick my seat as I did on my original booking. He said no. He seemed to be angry and told me if I did not want to do that then I should call customer service in New York. I left the airport and called New York customer service and I was on the phone stuck on hold for approximately two hours before I was disconnected by their telephone system. I had no better luck with their customer service. Today March 31, 2021, I once again tried to contact the ticket agent and customer service by phone with the exact same results.

One of the most difficult times for us, and for him, is when we need to fly.

At some point in the flight my son got very uncomfortable and began crying, loudly. My wife began the usual routine of holding him, walking with him, etc… trying to sooth and calm his nerves, but nothing was working. As this was happening, out of nowhere, our son began to throw up uncontrollably. My wife was shocked and started crying herself. At this exact moment a frustrated passenger got up and began verbally abusing her - yelling in front of the entire plane that she needs to get our child in check.

Check-in at EWR was smooth after the compulsory security interrogation (I strongly recommended one arrives 3+ hours if flying El Al in order to complete the check-in process). My interrogation lasted 10 minutes and it helped I was traveling with a group to Israel. Everything on the plane both ways looked brand new and the IFE was fantastic and state-of-the-art. Flight attendants were friendly and attentive and responded quickly to call button requests. Food (two meals) on both flights were edible and alright (chose the chicken dish on both legs and it was alright). Dairy/""breakfast"" meal was a choice of blintzes or an omelet on both flights as well. Chose the blintzes both times - they were nothing special but I was full from the previous meal. Check-in at Tel Aviv once past the initial security interrogation was fairly quick. My seat was assigned at the gate although they termed it as ""standby,"" which makes me wonder if they didn't expect me to be on the plane due to extra security searches of my bags? I can only guess that. At the TLV gate, approached the desk to get a seat assignment as the flight was boarding. The first lady I approached hardly looked at the computer and my ticket and said: ""it wasn't ready."" I waited 15 minutes and without any announcement coming about ""standby"" passengers, I approached a different gate agent who promptly assigned me a seat. They could not fulfill my request for an aisle seat but the gate agent was gracious with his apology. On the return flight, I was seated next to an unaccompanied minor and the flight attendant was very attentive toward him, asking how he was and if he needed anything during the flight. El Al does have online check-in but it's useless if you are checking bags or have to go through extra security procedures.

Emirates,1,"""refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage""","The issues I encountered include a significant problem with their cancellation policy, lack of responsiveness from their customer service team, concerning safety practices, refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage, an extensive delay during the return flight, and a stark contrast in service quality between Economy and Business class. Regarding the cancellation policy, I received misleading information from three representatives, who assured me that I would receive a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours. However, they failed to mention the crucial condition that this only applied when the flight was at least 7 days after the initial booking. As a result, I tried to cancel within the 24-hour window but could only reschedule. This cost me a $500 loss vs. the option of cancelling and booking a new flight for the following day. Despite Emirates acknowledging in writing their mistake, they repeatedly refused to provide a price match or refund, and eventually even stopped replying to my follow up messages on the open complain. The lack of responsiveness from Emirates compounded my frustration. Numerous follow-up messages went unanswered, showing a lack of interest in resolving the issues I faced.  During the flight, I was alarmed by a safety practice where all blankets were collected and piled in front of the emergency exits.  Emirates also declined to reimburse me for one of two damaged pieces of luggage, despite the damage occurring during their handling.  Furthermore, the return flight experienced a significant delay for a missing document, resulting in passengers being seated on the plane for over two hours, including boarding time.

We had booked a return flight from/to STL-COK via YYZ and DXB. The first flight from STL to YYZ was by its code share partner Air Canada. Unfortunately, just a couple weeks before our flight, Air Canada changed the flight time such that it was not possible to catch the flight from YYZ to DXB. We reached out to Emirates, our primary booking partner, to rebook and were provided a rerouting option through ORD (Chicago) for an additional $3300 for 3 tickets. Annoyed by this suggestion, we requested to fly Air Canada flight the day before, which was turned down because of unavailability of economy class tickets. Because of lack of viable options, we decided to drop the flight from STL-YYZ but retain the flights from YYZ-DXB and DXB-COK, with the idea of booking our own flights from STL-YYZ. We booked this flight for the day before, so we also had to book overnight stay in YYZ. When we filed a travel claim which needed a certificate of flight delay, Emirates asked me to reach out to Air Canada. Unfortunately, Air Canada had none of our names in their system and it was impossible to reach their customer service for further assistance. In summary, we have spent almost $2800 (flight tickets + overnight stay) for Air Canada/Emirates' incompetence and are unable to get a 'flight delayed' certificate to process our legitimate claim. Please beware when booking flights through Emirates because it takes absolutely NO responsibility for their code share partners' mistakes.

I needed to be seated away from any active passengers to ensure I would be able to have enough sleep which was necessary due to my medical condition. On the day of my travel to Ethiopia I went to check in and discovered my seat was changed from 50L to 13B which was next to children and was in the middle. I spoke with your ticketing agent at the airport who was not willing to assist me. I then spoke to a Manager who told me they are not selling seats but are selling tickets and that seat reservations made in advance didn’t really matter. I was almost crying because the airline staff were very rude and not willing to assist me at all. I feel they were calling me a liar telling me that I had not reserved seat 50L. Another passenger who overheard my conversation with your Manager gave me her seat which helped with my situation. Once I arrived in Ethiopia I went to the Addis Ababa office Which is the one in Addis Ababa to speak with someone concerning the negative experience I had with my seat reservation. Your staff member took my statement and I was told by her that I would receive an email containing the report your staff member had written. As of today, I have not received an email. I then asked her for assistance with my seat reservation for my return flight. She confirmed seat 50L was reserved for me and apologized for the negative experience I had on my flight to Ethiopia. Three days prior to my return flight back to the United States, I checked to confirm once again that I was seated in seat 50L. I then discovered that my seat reservation had been changed to seat 27B. I was really upset and when I contacted your airline I was told my seat had changed due to a change in the aircraft for the return flight. I asked why your airline does not send out an email when they change a passengers seat reservation, the agent on the phone for your airline told me that the best seat is always given to a Crew member. I was completely was shocked to hear that. I went to the Ethiopian Airlines office again to fix my seat reservation to what your agent had reserved for me. I spent three days of my vacation going from one office to another office to resolve my seat reservation problem as your App was giving me a system error.

This was one of the dirtiest and least attractive airline lounges I’ve ever been in. We left within minutes of arriving. 2) Many of Etihad’s online systems both app and online - just don’t function correctly. It was not possible to manage any part of my booking online or via the app. Not possible to choose seats or check-in. 3) While the plane is beautiful, scratch and you’ll discover that beauty is only skin deep. Many of the new plane’s innovations do no function properly. Outlets don’t work, the silly built-in phone charger didn’t work, the entertainment controller was extremely unresponsive and didn't work effectively. Seat was not comfortable compared to other business class seats. 4) The bathrooms were not clean and did not function well. 5) Worst of all on this flight was the service. While the flight attendants were nice enough, they didn’t provide some of the basic service I'd expect even if flying economy. Glasses and water bottles were never collected, my empty coffee mug sat on my tray for almost an hour and no one ever thought to ask if I wanted a refill. 6) The cabin was kept ridiculously warm making it impossible to sleep. 12 hour flight without a minute of sleep.

I had just arrived at the airport for my flight when my original flight changed. This wasn’t even a delay! Suddenly, I was now flying a completely different route, on a completely different airline, on a different day. So, to start off this poor experience they failed to inform their customers in a timely manner about these big changes. Next my new flight was booked for 5:30am the following morning. Eventually I was assisted at the Eurowings Discover desk and managed to get booked into a hotel about 10 minutes away from the hotel. The next morning, I had to make sure I was at the airport in time for my flight, meaning I had to wake up at 3am (bear in mind I only got to the hotel room at around 9 pm the night before). Leaving this early meant I missed my complimentary breakfast and I had to pay for my own transport back to the airport as the hotel’s shuttle service was not yet operational. After successfully flying with the new airline, Delta, I arrived at my first destination. After arriving at my connecting destination, I had an 11–hour layover where I had to try keep myself occupied (thanks to the Eurowings Discovers fantastic new flight itinerary they chose for me – sarcasm!). Once arriving at my final destination, I voiced my poor experience to Eurowings Discovers customer care. 1 month later I received a really promising response from them in which they apologized for their poor service delivery as well as offering me compensation to the amount of which they thought was sufficient. I must say I was very happy with the compensation offer they had proposed, and I accepted their apology. They asked me to send through my banking details so that they could transfer the money into my account. After responding to their email, I sent through the required information, only to get one last slap in the face from this joke of an airline.

Service started with a welcome drink (water, orange juice, wine or beer) then dinner. Once dinner was served and cleaned, they dimmed out the cabin lights so passengers can sleep.

The orchid decoration on the restroom wall is a very nice touch. Inflight entertainment is quite good but the layout is quite confusing. I didn't know they have many more options until the last moments before we started our descent. The lights came back on just before second meal (breakfast) is served, a very tasty Chinese congee.

Some reviews made me a bit hesitant to fly Fiji Airways, but I am glad that I did! The online check-in was easy and their ground personnel at the baggage drop counter was friendly and helpful. Also the boarding went smooth and all four flights I had departed on time. On one of my flights, just before take-off, a steward came to me and asked me whether I preferred to move to another seat that had an empty seat next to it, because of my height (6 foot 6/1.95 m.). I think this was very kind of him and in general I found the stewards on board very friendly and willing to help. The food and the in-flight entertainment was alright. It may not be as fancy or shiny as the food and entertainment you get at huge airlines like Emirates or Qatar, but for the money it was good value. For the meals you had a vegetarian and non-vegetarian option and the in-flight entertainment was sufficient. (again, Emirates may have a 150 movies to choose from and Fiji only 30, but you can't watch them all anyway) Also the seats were fine and just like any other company (besides maybe the more luxurious A380 seats). I would really like to recommend Fiji Airways to fly with if you want a good value for money.

But then this is the reality. Two months and about 8 emails back and forth with their customer service and I only have points for 2 legs of the flight of 4 in total. Non responsive (or rather non existent) customer service, talking to a different person every time, being re-directed to other departments etc etc. I filed an official complaint on their website now and guess what: after clicking 'submit' the screen is stuck on the 'creating your case' window. Very Finnair. They don't have any proper customer service. It has always been an airline that charges premium prices but the service has always been questionable. In the past few years it has become just non existent. Just imagine, if those of us who have Gold status and have a special email we can reach out to, if we can' get any service, then I can't imagine what it's like for regular travellers. It is so frustrating. They take advantage of Finnish people and charge insane prices. And OK, we can even accept that, but that you then don't even get the benefits is really, I don't know.  For instance, the gold level awards you 4 business class upgrades. But they will almost never allow you to cash those in. If there are available business class seats, you can buy them, but if you want to cash your upgrade in then the answer is no, no availability.

On a business trip to St. Petersburg, Russia for a week, decided to pay a little extra for flexible tickets in case I would finish up early - and I did. Go to the Finnair site a few days ahead of return tip, select an earlier flight and get told the fee for the new ticket would be 0 - excellent. When confirming the change a generic error message comes up, and the site does not allow me to do anything further. I immediately try contacting their customer chat but after navigating the chatbot menus for a few minutes it puts me in line for an operator then immediately hangs up because the volume of requests is too high. The next day I log on to their site again, and this time my new flight shows up under the booking - great! I then reasonably assume the change went through as planned, and that the error only came at a later step in the process. A few more days of my trip pass until it's time to check-in, and only when trying to do so does another error message appear telling me I can't check-in and to contact Finnair specifically at a number in Finland. Obviously calling an overseas customer service number is pretty annoying with queues and all, but I do so and spend 30 minutes waiting to no avail - no queue number is given, only that they are currently receiving an exceptional number of requests. At this point I am running out of time but feel my best bet at actually getting service will be at the airport counter itself, so I make sure to arrive there with an hour extra to spare. There is no Finnair staff at the airport, but the local Russian ground staff are very helpful - basically explaining that the system says I need to pay a EUR100 fee to complete the rebooking. This was not the info I was given on the Finnair site when requesting the rebook, and does not make sense with my ticket category having free rescheduling, but after spending 90 minutes at the airport trying to sort this out - with both ground staff and myself trying to reach Finnair - I relent and pay the extra fee instead of missing my flight entirely. I obviously know it will be a nightmare to reclaim this from the airline later, but I swear to at least try. On my return flight I have a connection in Helsinki, Finnair's home airport, so here I figure at least I can talk to their staff in person and get a little more clarity. I don't have time to leave the security area and seek out the ticketing office, but I track down two of Finnair's transfer desks at least, but they are both unmanned! Since returning home last night I have tried their chat twice more, again I get disconnected immediately because the volume of requests is too high. I obviously cannot find an email address to contact them at, and I simply don't have the patience to be in a phone queue for hours. So in sum - multiple individuals (me, my wife, airport ground staff) have tried to reach Finnair through multiple means (phone, chat, in-person at home airport) without any luck - all to understand why their website has failed to rebook my flight at the listed price, then not informed about the issue they created either so I could address it prior to actually traveling.

Frontier Airlines,1,"""met with great difficulty via the app""","It wasn't that the voucher number didn't work, but rather that there was no time/place to enter it throughout the new transaction on your website/app as per instructed in the voucher email. The only thought I have is that the app went through a new update as the one I have been using the past few days clearly had a new interface and somewhere in the translation, the process was changed or buttons not added properly in the html etc... prior to launch? My hope is that the voucher can be added to the flight I already purchased for tomorrow. In other news, while attempting to cancel my earlier flight from today, I was met with great difficulty via the app (possibly resulting from the aforementioned update?) After going in many circles with the chatbot and waiting something like 35 min for a representative to arrive on the chat, I got frustrated and began searching for a phone number online to which I found a number claiming to connect me to the Philadelphia airport Frontier desk, but rather, connected me to a third party scammer who ended up ""canceling my flight"" with you somehow (likely getting a refund of some sort themselves) while simultaneously charging me an additional fee to cancel. While I don't expect any kind of reparations for that as it was a result of my own impatience/frustration. I'm guessing by my talks with other frustrated customers, that they are equally frustrated when trying to resolve issues with your airline, which can't be good for business. Having been a supporter of your airline in the past and knowing of your former bancruptcy claim, and fully understanding the role of chatbots, etc.in today's society; I fully believe that an investment in more customer care personel, empowering those people to resolve things beyond the standard voucher system and realistically solving all the other issues with unreliability that seemingly are plagueing your airline as of late so that the necessity for resolvement becomes negated is the only way through your current situation.

The first flight from O Hare was canceled after multiple delays, and they finally agreed to reroute me through a city 200 miles from there! Since I was expected at my destination, I took it. 2nd leg had a slight delay also, but I got there 24 hours after expected. 2. Flight back had 2 legs as well. 1st leg again delayed. No mention of 2nd leg was made by staff, but the layover time was enough that I made it. Or so I thought. The flight from Atlanta, which was supposed to be at 10:27 PM, was announced as delayed to 11:20 PM. OK, I thought. No biggie. At 10 PM, they announced it was delayed to 2 AM because they didn't have staff. Here's the kicker. If they found staff, they would leave earlier. So passengers couldn't move from the gate. No meal vouchers for this 4 hour delay. Clock kept ticking. 12:30 AM, I went to get some coffee. Came back. The board at the gate says departure at 12:25 AM. All passengers were still waiting, but I panicked and asked the agent, and he says, sorry, mistake. It's at 2 AM. Then, all gate agents left. 1 AM, 1:30 AM, 2 AM... 100-plus passengers are at the gate desk, calling out for someone to come and update us. I started talking to their online agent.  No customer service telephone line. It takes 15 minutes to get one online. He closed the chat unexpectedly. Ok, let's say it was an accident, but given their behavior this far you get the point. I try again. It takes 10 minutes. The agent says all their systems are down, and she can't tell me what's happening with my reservation. I tell her, I'm asking for flight status. Surely, you have that. Or air traffic control would have something to say. She keeps repeating all systems are down, and she cannot tell me more. I ask for a supervisor. She won't get me one. 3:15 AM, someone shows up at the gate desk and says they're just waiting for pilot. Passengers are really panicking by now and asking why we aren't being kept informed. The 2 agents who came out smirk at the crowd and say they don't have to let any of us fly. They say the pilots have to wait out the time before they can fly again and ask all of us to move to a different gate. Okay, passengers agree, and we walk. 3:27 AM, I get a text saying flight is at 3:30 AM. Then, gate agents leave again from the new gate. They come back around 4 and say flight canceled. We can go to ticketing counter to get refund or reschedule. Oh, you also have to get your checked in luggage. If you know Atlanta airport. I get my luggage and go to the ticketing counter all the way at the terminal entrance. Huge lines. They say next flight to anywhere in Illinois will be in 2 to 3 days. At that point, I ask how much will I be refunded, because another ticket booked with another airline for just that short leg would cost 3 times as much. Answer is: I don't know. If I choose to stay (at the expense of 2 lost vacation days), will I have hotel covered? Yes, but meal and hotel won't happen until 3 PM.

The guy at the counter said “OK well I will take your bag off of your hands for $155”. Tickets might be a little cheaper on this airline but trust me they get you in the end.  If you want to choose your seat, it’s anywhere from $40-$65, if not, they assign a seat for you randomly. We had a 6:00 AM flight and TSA did not open up until five it took over an hour to get through security, which is not the airlines fault, but then we had to run for the plane and barely made it on. If you don’t check in at least 24 hours before the flight online, they will not check you in. There was a gentleman at the counter next to us that had the same flight as us but he did not check online and they bumped him to the next flight , that’s horrible!

This would have left me stranded in Detroit for almost two more days. I decided that the best option would have been to get a rental car and drive to Atlanta and drop the car at the airport so I could arrive in Atlanta around noon time.

Frontier Airlines,1,"""not worth the cheap ticket""","On June 26, 2023, my flight to Trenton NJ, via Raleigh Durham, was cancelled. No explanation was given, but we found out later it was due to severe thunder storms. This can't be helped. We were told at the gate to go back to the ticket counter to re-book or cancel. I went to ticketing and asked a Frontier agent where I needed to be for re-booking. Her response was ""Over there"". She didn't indicate where 'over there' was, so I asked again. Same response. I said, ""Do you mean behind this woman (who was in line)?"", and she said ""No. Over there where the person in green is standing"". So I moved over to the end of the line. One by one we were moved to another line for rebooking and after about 30 minutes, I, too, was moved. I stood there for another 20-30 minutes when a Frontier employee walked over to us and informed us that if we were to re-book, we needed to be in the original line, the one we'd all just left. I tried to ask him if we were expected to go to the end of the line, but he interrupted me and said he would answer question once we all moved. I tried again. Same thing. Another passenger tried for clarification, and again, the very rude response. And once again, someone tried to ask, and once again, he interrupted before the gentleman had a chance to get his question out. I finally said that I was not going to the end of the line because I'd already been there once, and he then told me, ""Then you won't be re-booked"". Not one of us was angry or rude or disrespectful. We were appalled at his behavior toward us but no one was complaining about the cancelled flight or the long line. Some folks had been there for two days. Of the dozen or so standing around me, we all commented to one another that we would never fly Frontier again. After moving over to 'the other' line, I went back to the Frontier employee and asked his name. He interrupted again, saying he'd answer questions when we were all in line. I told him I didn't have a question other than could I please have his name. At that point he looked at me and said, ""I don't have to give you my name"". That's when I cancelled my ticket. Never, in my 72 years, have I witness such complete and utter disrespect to a group of people, and for no reason. Frontier Airlines deserves the terrible reputation it has. It's run on a bate and switch mentality. Just take a look at it's website. It has absolutely no regard for it's customers. Try finding a phone number where you can actually speak to someone. It's airline employees must hate their jobs, if their 'customer service' is any indication. I'm fully aware that these employees had probably had a couple of tough days, but what about the woman in front of me who had been trying for two days to get back to her kids? There was no respect or regard for her at all. This was my first and last experience with Frontier. They should be ashamed of themselves for the total lack of professionalism they display. I wonder what corners they cut on their aircraft. It's not worth the cheap ticket. Life is too short.

Terminal 1 in Honolulu had been completely refurbished from the last time I had visited 10 years ago, and feels very modern, airy and welcoming, but less ""island-style"" - simple and relaxing, which is what the other airports around Hawaii feel like. Security took less than five minutes, and there was plenty of seating at our gate. I had two trips with Hawaiian, from Honolulu to Lihue/Kauai and Honolulu to Kahului/Maui. Both these flights are what I would describe as ""up and down"" flights, literally 3 minutes after we reached cruising altitude we already started our descent. One of the funniest things that I realised was that on both trips, the flights out of Honolulu was operated by the same aircraft (N483HA) and left from the same gate A19. When I asked the gate agent on my second trip about the aircraft's registration, I told her ""I flew this exact plane and left from this exact gate to Kauai two months ago!"" She was extremely nice and joked that I should buy it, since it was ""my plane."" That really made my day. Onboard, even though these aircraft are around 20 years old, they did not feel too old, and the 2-3 seating configuration is great for couples and families. I definitely recommend choosing an A window seat when departing from Honolulu to get a great view of Waikiki beach. The seats themselves actually don't recline and have a small drinks tray - no way you could get any work on your laptop done. Considering the longest flights these planes do are 45 minutes, I don't see any issue with the bus-like seats. The surprising thing is that during these ""up and down"" flights, the flight attendants still come round and offer passengers water, juice or coffee, the latter only on morning flights. Even with the limited service due to the short flight time, I still had great interactions with the flight attendants. The return from Kahului/Maui was a bit of an issue, where all the flights that day got delayed due to a storm in Honolulu. I went to the check in counter to ask if they could rebook me onto an earlier flight, and I was rebooked at no extra charge. Hawaiian Airlines' operation has a lot of quick turnarounds giving very little leeway for delays, the knock on effects went on for hours. However given how quickly the agent was able to rebook me onto an earlier flight (and luckily I didn't end up in a middle seat) it shows that they can handle a crisis very well. Indeed the flight they had rebooked me onto was still delayed, but it meant I got into Honolulu an hour earlier than if I was still on my original flight. Overall, Hawaiian certainly excels in terms of its product, and beats other US regional carriers by miles. They really carry the spirit of Aloha onboard and I would definitely choose them over Southwest when flying Inter-Island, except if I needed to check any luggage.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,4/1/2023,Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Honolulu,Kahului,TRUE,United States,TRUE,Domestic

They let me on. All my bags did not make it however. Filed a claim at airport on Maui. Was provided a number that doesn't work. Still trying to reach a human and when I do they pass me off to another number that starts with thank you for your patience, but we are helping others and then plays music that is from WW2 cabaret with no response while asking me if I would like to participate in a survey after they don't help me. So here I am with 3 lost bags, no one to help track it down and no one at that airline is hired to care. It is structured incompetence, insensitive employees on an airline that has a monopoly on this island for most inter-island travel. Not sure what to do next as no human ever responds on their phone line, which is recorded for training persons. My best guess is they immediately fire anyone who actually helps!

No one from the airline came out to direct the passengers to next steps. Line for ticketing did not move. Luggage did not come out until 5 hours after the flight had been scheduled to take off. I had to book my own flight out for the next day and book a hotel, totalling $1,000+ for 3 people. This is an additional significant expense and hardship for my family. Who knows if and when I will ever be reimbursed. This airline needs to get it together and have a process for communicating to passengers what the process is in these situations.

Hawaiian Airlines,1,"""felt so helpless and disregarded""","The flight was a connecting flight to Seattle, WA from Honolulu HNL connecting in Maui OGG. The Maui to Seattle flight was delayed by over 4 hours and we were not informed or notified in any manner. We had arrived from Honolulu and were waiting by the gate when we noticed the departure time change. I was traveling with my wife and 9 month old son and we did not expect this and didn't know what to do since this was our first time travelling with him. My wife went to inquire about the situation and was told by the manager/chief at the gate desk and they said ""there is nothing we can do"". She was worried because we did not have any baby food left or formula and it was frustrating. I went to speak to the same manager/chief and ask if we could get any assistance because we would have to sit in an airport with an infant for an additional 4 hours on top of the initial 2 hour of our flight. While I was talking to them they called security and threatened to get us thrown out of the airport because manager said she will not speak to us because ""we could not understand even is she tried to explain it"" I believe she was trying to imply we were incapable of understanding her and we need to move out of the way so she can help other customers. Shas just gotten another frustrated customer who was yelling and screaming at her and being hysterical but she gave her a completely different treatment and gave her another flight since she was from there and decided to flight out another time. We stood back and record while the security arrived and started questioning us. This was so frightening for us. We didnt know what was going to happen to us. Were we going to get arrested? were they going to take out infant son from us? what were we going to do in a place that is foreign to us and we did not know anyone there so thats where we were recording for our own safety. We decided to wait it out because it felt like the more inquiries or help we requested it was met with aggression and complete disregard of our infant child.

Hawaiian Airlines,2,"""stressful and unnecessary situation""","This was such a stressful and unnecessary situation. My husband is Navy and we were stationed in Hawaii in February of this year. Hawaii has very strict pet laws, so while I got all that sorted, our cat lived with a friend on the mainland. I finally booked a flight with Hawaiian Airlines for May 5th for my friend to fly our cat out to be with us, and just to double check that I had all my ducks in a row, I called their customer service line. I went over everything with the representative on the phone, including asking her specifically if our cat was good to fly on this flight and she said yes. I even offered to pay for the ticket ahead of time, which is insane that they don't let you do that, it is first come first serve since they only allow 4 pets on the plane at a time. We get off the phone and I am content that I did everything I was supposed to. My friend drives an hour and a half to Atlanta airport, gets there at 3:30am for her 6am flight, and the front desk denies a ticket to our cat. All they can tell us is that there is an error in their system and they cannot book her a ticket. They were incredibly incompetent. I was on the phone with her the whole time listening. They were rude to my friend and told her to just go the gate without a ticket for our cat! They held her up so much that she had to run from the train to her gate, and then come to find out they had the wrong gate printed on her ticket so she missed the flight anyway! We got on the phone with customer service and mind you, it's 11pm where we are. We then spend the next hour explaining what just happened and asking Hawaiian to fix it, and eventually they get us to a very nice manager named Joyce who helped us schedule another flight for the same day at 10:35am. Time comes for our friend to buy the ticket for our cat for the new flight, and the same problem happens. It took another hour for us to get a straight answer from front desk; Hawaiian Airlines had booked both flights with JetBlue as the first leg of the flight, and Hawaiian Airlines does NOT allow connecting flights with other airlines to carry pets. You'd think a manager on the customer service line might know that before booking our tickets and wasting more of our time. So if she had made it to the gate in time, they still would have turned our cat away. At that point we told our friend to just go home. My husband stayed up until 8am on the phone with their customer service trying to get them to fix us another flight for the next day, but they told us the only way they could do it is if we purchased two separate round trips and arranged for the times to line up. There are no nonstop flights to Hawaii that allow pets that fly out of Atlanta, so she would have had to stop in Seattle. There are so many risks involved in buying tickets that way, not to mention possible delays, going back through TSA when she lands in Seattle and the fact we did not want our cat in a carrier for that long. In the end we just asked for a refund. They gave us an additional $70 (whoopie) for wasted time, and apologized for the ""miscommunication"". We are booking another flight with Alaska Airlines instead. I was devastated, sobbing in the middle of the night because I have been so stressed out planning this for months , and they ruined it in the last hour. Never ever using them again.

My wife and I have traveled to Hawaii every January for the past 15 years and every year I contemplate hiring a boat to take me from island to island rather than dealing with this lousy airline. My most recent experience, I had booked two one-way tickets (Maui - Kona and Kona - Honolulu). My plans changed and I only needed the Kona to Honolulu portion of the trip. Rather than being able to make this change online I used chat, text and three phone calls. After more than 2 hours, I was told by the agent that I had to cancel this ticket and then rebook it completely. I said, ok and asked the agent to rebook the flight for me. I was then told that they couldn't rebook it, but I had to use the credit voucher online. After waiting 48 hours, and no credit voucher appearing in email, I logged in and tried to find the credit. Another two hours of waiting for a chat agent, only to be told that I couldn't book this online and had to speak with an agent. Ok, I call the number....90 minutes later, I'm told that ""because I called an agent, they were going to charge me $25 for each ticket for a processing fee."" So, my ticket that had a value of $116 per person, and I was trying to rebook a new ticket for $39, and I was going to immediately lose the remaining value of the credit, was really only saving me $14 off of just abandoning the original ticket and rebooking online. I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in all my years of traveling. Unfortunately, they have a monopoly when it comes to inter-island travel so you have to use them which I guess is why they can get away with providing such lousy service. You literally could not pay me to take one of their flights out of the Hawaiian islands to their mainland or Asia destinations.",Couple Leisure,First Class,1/1/2023,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Kona,Honolulu,TRUE,United States,TRUE,Domestic

Upon arrival into Honolulu one of our bags didn't make it. The man at the Honolulu Hawaiian airlines baggage desk was super rude and quite frankly it felt like he didn't even want to serve us. We filed a 'irregular baggage report' and did the standard protocol. The man at the desk said they would call first thing the following day and let us know our bag whereabouts. The next morning we received no call so decided to call the aiport as we where staying 1.5 hours from the airport. We were put on hold for 3.5 hours and then 2 hours where no one picked up the phone. The following day was the same! On hold for 3 hours and no answer. When someone finally answered they said they had found the bag and would send it out immediately. 2 days later we still hadn't received the bag and once again couldn't get through on the phone to anyone at the airport. We ended up driving to the airport where there were 3 staff working on the hawaiian airline baggage desk not serving anyone talking amongst themselves. When I asked why no one was answering their phone they all laughed. My bottom line!

It started with them canceling my husbands and I’s flight during Covid and not offering any sort of voucher for a last minute hotel. If you can imagine, getting a hotel day of on Honolulu is the worst. Talk about cockroaches and a nasty bed. Not to mention being put on hold for 3 hours only to give up, call back later and be put on hold again for hours. That was in 2021. Later that year we purchased tickets and they were unable to check us in as though our tickets never even existed. que going to the “services” line in the Honolulu airport and coming close to missing our flight - not because we weren’t early but because the wait in the line was nearly out the door. And the employee barely knew what she was doing so everything took forever. If you’re unable to do the job properly you need more training. Now I go to check in in 2022 and they got rid of the check in lines all together and have kiosks and people walking around- you weigh your own bag etc. remember this is all at the Honolulu location. If you have an issue- just go wait in a line for hours and miss your flight. They got rid of free check in bags for military spouses (no other airline does this) the customer service said because they have “issues” with people sneaking bags or something - no, it’s clearly cutting corners. Active duty personnel is still allowed to have free checked bags but they have to go to the line that take 3 hours to simply have one checked bag. So they make you really contemplate if that free checked bag is worth missing your flight! Also all of this with no heads up with changed in policy’s. Unfortunately I already booked multiple flights with them the next month because they pop up the cheapest. But out of principal and their treatment of military and corner cutting I won’t fly with them anymore. Military and their spouses already have a hard enough time traveling around, paying for way more flights than normal people, so it’s clear how they feel about military. And before anyone says anything about military occupation, we all Know big corporations don’t care about that.

Told him I was allowed to use it on flight 51 on the way to HNL. He said no I cannot use my machine on an overnight flight, my throat literally closes up from snoring.

Booked first class tickets for the family in row 1 because a representative from their dial-in hotline said that’s where the bassinet would be. We decided to spend the additional money to ensure our 4 month old infant son (and us) would be comfortable. First, there was no first class boarding. Waiting in line with what seemed like every other boarding class. Second, arrived at our seats to discover there was no bassinet. The bassinet was the primary driver for the splurge on the 1st class seats… If I had seen the old ratty seats in the first class cabin in advance, I would have never opted to spend the extra money. Oh well… nothing the flight stewardess/stewards could do. They were incredibly polite. The plan takes off and everything sounds odd. After about an hour or two in air, we have to turn around due to mechanical failure. We were incredibly disappointed because it was virtually impossible to get our kids into the plane. We’ll it happens… Seemed like onboard crew was not given any information. Meals were served and unfortunately did not have much time to eat before crew had to clear everything for landing. We ended up landing back at LAX with emergency services crews everywhere. Quite literally a fleet of fire trucks. We disembark the plane and are instructed to stay by the gate. We stay there for quite a while. At some point, I notice the agents were no longer at the gate we exited the plan through but at a new gate with a new flight time and arrival time. I ask if this was our new flight and the response was less than enthusiastic. No explanation. No details. Seemed like they were looking to get back to their conversation and I was rudely interrupting. I go back to my seat and then the manager comes onto the PA system and informs everyone that the flight is delayed. I once again go to the boarding desk at the new gate and ask- “So, what are the options now?”. Answer now is “You’ll get a room, meal vouchers and then come back for a 1:45pm flight. I respond by telling them I would simply go home. I have 2 very young kids and it’s going to be incredibly difficult to I come back that early in the morning… what are my options? Answer was “well you can take the room and voucher or not… that’s up to you. If you want a refund, you would have to call. I forget the name of the department they mentioned. Once again very short and semi rude replies. Whatever, we’re now instructed to pickup our bags at bag. I call the hotline and more of the same. Essentially go on the early morning flight or travel 2 days later. No compensation for the lost time, lost money in other bookings, transportation, etc. not that I had asked but their general go to was “file a complaint”. In conclusion- planes are old and tatty. Food was by far the worse I’ve had on an airplane, and almost all levels of customer service were incredibly bad. I’ve never seen an airline with staff so uninterested in what they do. I do have to note their in-cabin crew was very nice. They seemed to have truly tried to help. Everyone else was god-awful.

My husband and I was offered multiple times a companion ticket discount of $100 but when I tried to use it online, it errored out, the website asked me to call their customer service and provided a phone number. I called in, explained that their website keeps error out upon using the discount. The rep told me that they ""are aware of it"", Reasonably enough, she offered to give me one time courtesy of not charging me $25 for using the phone service.

Luckily, I did the math, and told her that, with the price they are offering me, I am probably better off buying the same tickets online without the $100 companion discount - What a trap! I insisted she to talk with her manager for at least matching the website pricing since I had to call in due to their website error. About an hour later, the rep did call me back, offering a much lower pricing than their first offer. I made the purchase. Only then, I noticed, adding taxes and everything, the actual discount I got is only $61 than my original website pricing, not the $100 discount as their ""earned discount"" offer of $100. Their explanation is: The base pricing for the ticket, since our phone conversation to get the $100 discount took so long (~3 hours), has gone up from $496.56 to $562! So, the actual cost for me to call in is more than the $25 phone change cost since their website didn't work. Yes, the website problem which should cost them in fact cost me instead!

In order to enjoy a trip from Paradise home, one must pass through the gates of purgatory, which is another word for Hawaiian Airlines within the Daniel Inouye airport in Honolulu. For two seniors traveling with luggage, this was an excruciating experience. The three separate (and long) lines needing to endure just in order to check baggage was senseless. The walk from the main terminal to the gate to the departure area might as well have been from downtown Waikiki, which might have been more pleasant. And then there's the food onboard. Or more precisely, the absence of anything worthwhile to consume. Fortunately we learned our lesson on the outbound flight after going hungry for about eight hours.

On 07/23/22, there was an issue on a plane and all passengers had to deplane and take another flight. i planned a day trip to Kauai departing Honolulu at 7am and coming back at 6 pm. however, because of the delay, now i have to cancel all booked activities. The airplane is still not departing (as of 7/23/22 8:40 am). One good thing about Hawaiian airlines is they are very consistent - they are very consistent in providing well below average service.

She told me to go back to the self service to check if I dropped my ticket in which she could have just easily printed it herself because she had already verified my ID. I went back and grabbed my ticket from the floor and gave it to her. She then told me she didn’t need it because she will print a new set of tickets.

Hawaiian Airlines,2,"""Little about this flight was impressive""","We recently celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary and we wanted to fly to HNL, where we spent our Honeymoon. We purchased First Class R/T tickets on Hawaiian Airlines. Not much about the experience was impressive, and I wish we'd given that $7,000 to the Ukrainian war effort. The agent gave us the gate number but said nothing about the need to line up at the gate and be checked in for a wrist band to avoid having to get screened once we arrived in HNL. About 20 minutes prior to departure we realized that people were queuing up and receiving wrist bands, so we got in line. After having been in line for about 15 minutes, the same agent who had taken our bag at the ticket counter advised those of us still in line that it was too late to be issued a wrist band and walked away. Not only had all of the extensive online pre-clearance effort been a waste of time but we only ended up boarding the flight a few minutes before the doors were closed prior to departure. I was livid before we left the gate and worked hard to not let such a poor showing on their part ruin our vacation before we left the ground. Little about this flight was impressive. The lie-flat seats belong not in first class but in an intermediate class of service. They are 6 abreast in the cabin. The lack of wi-fi at this juncture is inexcusable. iPads for entertainment? Really? Were we eligible to use the first-class lounge? What about the frequent flyer miles? Where would we find them, and can we have Delta FFMs instead? And then there was the food. Two chicken thighs with the skin on in a forgettable sauce was in-edible for me, I never eat dark-meat poultry. That was the extent of the food until breakfast, which wasn't much better. There were no snacks served in between on a flight exceeding 10 hours. Had my wife not brought her extensive survival rations that she typically takes when she flies to Asia, we would have been starving by the time we got to HNL. The return flight was equally pathetic--essentially Chef Boy-R-Dee ravioli without the sauce. It was tasteless and so dry we couldn't eat it all, and it was not a generous serving. Breakfast: also pathetic, we stopped and ate at First Watch on the way home. Like the food, the service was forgettable. Actually, it was nearly non-existent. If you don't ring a call button you won't see a Flight Attendant between meal services. Beverage choice in First Class is quite limited. Hawaiian offers a level of service that resembles Southwest Airlines. Do not under any circumstances purchase a first class ticket. Neither their Agents nor Flight Attendants are trained to provide that level of service. Their cabin interiors are dated and not adequately maintained. There is no WiFi. In Flight entertainment is via iPad, which must be purchased in coach. There is little customer service available from the company - virtually nothing in real time. I've been waiting for a response from them via their website for over a month, which is why I elected to post this online. We liked the fact that we could fly non-stop between Orlando and Honolulu; for less money we could have flown on Delta and, given the lengthy maintenance delay on our return flight we would have spent no more time had we connected in any of their hubs.

They are supposed to have some serious chefs that do their food and I would have given them kudos for the first trip. But the food coming back tasted about as good as it looked. It was supposed to be coq au vin (wine-braised chicken) with green onion chickpea cake. Well, the chicken was the stuff you leave after stripping away the meat from the chicken - the left-over giblets with gristle, fat, and skin. Yuk. The green onion cake had absolutely no flavor at all. You might as well have eaten a piece of the polyester pillow. And those little bitter mushroom things that looked like worms? What are they thinking? Seriously. A true chef understands that there must not only be flavor, there must be a visual appeal. This meal ruined the entire trip and tasted about as good as it looked. I nearly got sick to my stomach. My mother (who usually eats anything) also thought it was repulsive. YUK!! Overall I love Hawaiian airlines and I would fly with them again but they need to get a grip on the food.

Hawaiian Airlines,1,"""Worst customer experience calling them""","Not really specific for the flight information provided above, but when I tried to travel the next time (tried to book / cancel). On my previous trip, the flight was delayed by 12+ hours. Due to this, we received travel credits of $300 each for the next flights. Now trying to use this credit to book the trip, and wasted hours and hours due to it. Booked a flight that is 2-3 months away from now to KOA (Kona airport), so I thought the ticket price would be pretty stable. We booked the flight through the Hawaiian website, used up all the credit to save up so we ended up paying $118 each (it was $418 - $300 credit). The next day, we saw the price dropped to $358 per ticket, so we contacted customer service (the call was on hold 30+ min) to either get our price matched or cancel the flight. The customer service representative said I can get $418 full refunded to my credit card, which really didn't make sense so I confirmed it multiple multiple times and the associate confirmed that that is going to be the case. After a week, I only see $118 posted on my card. Contacted them again waiting 30+min again, they said they did refund $418 to the card and asked me to contact my credit card bank to confirm the refund amount. Did that and American Express confirmed that they only see $118 from Hawaiian. Called Hawaiian again, holding 30+ min again, and finally, they transferred to the supervisor (which took another 30+ min). Finally, the supervisor says they cannot do a full refund since $300 was charged by travel credit, and they can re-send the travel credit via email. I complained about my wasted time and also told him to please educate the customer service associate about this non-refundable travel credit information so people like me don't have to waste their precious time, and the supervisor just hung up on me without any answer! I don't know when or whether I'll be receiving my credit, and I really don't want to call them again for the credit not received yet, but I may have to.

Hawaiian Airlines,2,"""HAL got us where we needed - eventually""","We had booked a multi-leg trip through Delta that used ""Partner"" Hawaiian Airlines (HAL) between islands. For their part, HAL got us where we needed - eventually...but not without a lot of wasted vacation time and unnecessary anxiety. 1) An hour before check-in for the next day's flight to Kona we get a text from HAL that our flight was cancelled. Okay, cutting slack for COVID or whatever reason (none was given) we were still worried about how to continue the next leg of our trip. We had no place to stay if we couldn't travel, and expensive reservations waiting the next day. They gave us a Toll-Free number to ""call"", after hours of trying, all we got was busy signal and we never got through. There was no way to rebook on HAL website, since ticketing was through Delta. So, spending 4 hours on hold getting through to Delta we rebooked for a later HAL flight - but had to pay fare difference, even though it wasn't our fault we had to make a flight change. 2) Arriving at the airport, HAL was a mess. Although our reservation included checked bags, they insisted we had to pay because, ""we're not Delta Airlines."" I get that, but we paid Delta - who already paid HAL for our seats and baggage. 3) Finally getting on the plane, there were a ton of open seats. My guess is the earlier cancellation wasn't COVID related, just saving expense to consolidate flights. We were in Economy seats and after boarding, all Exit Rows were open. On any other airline, we've been allowed to move to open seats, but not on HAL. At first, the flight attendant said we couldn't sit there because of Exit Row requirements. I responded, ""as long as we meet Exit Row requirements, why can't we sit there?"" His response, ""more money."" I get it, they market them as Premium seating. After cancelled flights, additional charges and vacation time lost, the least HAL could have done was let us sit there. The Customer Service value would cost them nothing. No. Who sat there instead? Uniformed HAL employees, probably being repositioned. I'm not begrudging that staff deserves to be treated well, but aren't we the paying customers? Through everything it seemed the message HAL was sending was, we don't need you - you need us - so live with it. Easy fix - Obviously, HAL had our cell numbers, because they texted us that the flight was cancelled, due to low occupancy. It would have been easier for them to simply put us on another flight and tell us of the time change. Better yet, since there were only about 30 people booked, they could have called us. Rather than have us keep calling their toll-free and never getting through, one of their agents could have called us (same amount of time on the phone for their agents). We paid a premium for everything on this trip, costs were about 30% higher than in the past. We knew that going in.

You can’t check in now.” I said “it’s literally 7:16 right now, I was here trying fo check in but your kiosks are closed.” The agent speaking to me was very rude saying “well we closed at 7:15, you were supposed to check in 30 minutes before your flight.” (which is what I was doing). When I asked what I could do she shrugged saying “we are closed, come back tomorrow.” I have never seen an airline close all it’s windows before the last flights leave and they should definitely put this on your boarding information and say 45 minutes or 60 minutes since they don’t disclose that they close beforehand. I had to pay for a ticket the next day & I think it’s completely unacceptable that this airline closed before their last flights take off and they were definitely closed before the 30 minute window and were not helpful to reschedule me.

Getting seats assigned on the return portion was impossible at airport checkin on the outbound, and could only be done 24 hours prior to the last segment departure (not 24 hours before the first segment departure, as is standard).

When we arrived in Boston for our flights to Barcelona, we were told by the Iberia agent that four of our family members had boarding passes but one of our daughters did not have a confirmed pass. I showed the agent the emails I had received stating that all members of our family had been confirmed for the flight with American Airlines (through Iberia). We had flown to Boston from Indianapolis so I was able to show the Iberia agent our luggage tags for all five of our family members showing that we had confirmed flights for everyone from Indy to Barcelona with a layover in Boston. The agent searched and again said that she didn't have any record of our daughter being confirmed for the flight to Barcelona and was told that we needed to go to the American Airlines counter to discuss. We had already spent about 45 minutes with the Iberia agent at this point. The check-in counter for American was 1 mile from the Iberia counter and there were no shuttles available at that time to take us to the other terminal. All five family members ran from Iberia to AA (15 minutes) only to find out that there were no agents at the AA counter. It was now about 1.5 hours before our flight was to leave. So we ran back to the Iberia counter and told them there was nobody at the AA counter. I asked them to look again to see why they weren't seeing my daughter's boarding pass and how would it be possible for us to have all of our luggage for all five passengers from Indy to Barcelona approved on the initial check-in if we all did not have boarding passes. I asked if they could check to see if there was room on the flight to add my daughter because at that point I was desperate to get her on the flight and was willing to pay the money to make that happen. The agent said that ""Yes, there is room on the flight"" but that we need to book the flight with American. At this point, we had spent an additional 30 minutes arguing with them and it was getting close to the time that they were shutting the doors for the flight. Another Iberia agent was calling American for us and we were told that there was now someone waiting for us at American Airlines counter at the other terminal.

However, if I did not ask, I would not have received a refund. I was also informed that the two tickets were valid and non-refundable, which was not the case. It is unacceptable for a large airline like Iberia to charge a customer for two non-existent tickets. To make matters worse, I am still waiting for a resolution to my problem.

At check-in their computers were down, so it took a long time to check our luggage in and get boarding passes. Very unhelpful and not service oriented - I pulled up the health screener of my final destination, TLV, but it was not in a format they wanted so they said I would not fly if I couldn't pull it up. 3. Poor customer service. My seats from Madrid to TLV could not be assigned in DFW because they have subcontracted employees without full rights. Our first flight from DFW to Madrid got delayed, which is not a huge deal, but it got delayed even further because they could not match the passenger list with the amount of people on board. The flight crew could not understand the delay either, which they expressed to the passengers. Madrid to TLV was ok. TLV to Madrid 8/12 flight got moved up, I had to change my itinerary, customer service number would hang up on me. I could not find Iberia employees at the airport. Flight delayed and unprofessional - We were told the computers were down, they used a different airplane, and that we could sit anywhere. Then the ""musical chairs game began."" They started moving passengers left and right to balance the plane, just during take off and landing, then we could go back to our seats. The crew looked confused and dumb, like they didn't know what they were doing (because they didn't). Uncaring and very poor customer service - At Madrid they would not even consider putting me in an earlier flight, after disrupting my schedule, that was operated by AA on Iberia’s behalf because according to the Iberia agent: “They won’t give money to AA for taking you back.” At my arrival in DFW my luggage never arrived, despite being there way early, and the agent they had was again a subcontracted employee without access to their system, very young and untrained. He provided me with a handwritten form to fill out, no reference number was given to me. I did that and left because I was exhausted. 9a. Went to the airport the next day, Iberia’s counter was nowhere to be found, no employee available, nothing, just a ghost airline! The next day I call customer service and they could not help because their system was down, I proceed to explain my ordeal and worries about this flawed system and she replies - “I don’t control what happens at the airport and then cut off the call and sent me to a survey. Second CS call - She had said to call customer service back in 2 hours. I called customer service in 3 hours and the agent located the luggage in Madrid. I asked her to open a formal claim for my luggage, she said she couldn’t do that through her system. I exclaimed - “Then what are my options? I couldn’t do it at the airport, and I can’t do it now either.” She recommended for me to go to their website and fill out my complaint. Third CS call - I explained that I’d like to know if my luggage was in transit, the CS guy asked me for the reference number, and I explained that this airline is not like a normal one that would issue one at the airport. He assured me the luggage was in transit but without that PIR (reference number) they would not deliver it to my house, and I’d have to get it from the airport myself.

Situation was admittedly my fault: that I booked an itinerary (four flights total), and one flight had the wrong starting airport.

I noticed my mistake the day after booking and immediately called customer service, noting that I'd made an error and was there anything that could be done. Said I was willing to pay an up-charge, would like to stay with them, and was apologetic. Was told absolutely nothing could be done, per the policy. When asked if there was anyone else I might be able to speak to, I was said I could call back and hear the same response if I liked. I did that. The next agent told me there was no option, but that if I bought another ticket ($400), he'd be happy to help me speak with a refund team about getting back an airline tax. Would not tell me an amount but said it was negligible, and when I asked if he could find out, he said the refund team doesn't have a phone number and wouldn't engage until I paid up. Asked where I could submit a complaint and that was that. My complaint was this: by helping out a customer who made a mistake once, they would keep my business and very likely get the added bonus of another customer paying for the seat I gave up. As it stands, they get the certainty of losing my business and my family's business for good.

We paid for our bags to be checked through to San Francisco but found, the next morning, that Jet Blue demanded payment for baggage again from NYC to SFO. Icelandair was to put us up at a hotel in New York City for the night. When we arrived to the hotel at 11:30 (after an all day travel) the Crown Plaza Hotel said that Icelandair refused to pay them and to go back to the airport. There were other passengers from the same flight trying to get rooms as well. We just paid the hotel and will now have to deal with Icelandair to get a refund. Wish us luck.

I’ve always had a good experience, until recently. I am so incredibly disappointed in the poor customer service my boyfriend and I have received recently. I booked a trip to Europe to visit friends and naturally, I booked with Icelandair. My boyfriend decided he wanted to fly out to join us a few days into my trip. Per my recommendation, we booked him with Icelandair. During the time of booking, there was no travel restrictions for American tourists traveling to the Netherlands (our destination). For layovers in the KEF airport, it was required for American tourists to provide a negative COVID test OR a proof of vaccination. My boyfriend was scheduled to depart our local airport on September 5th. On September 4th the travel restrictions were altered and suddenly both a negative test and proof of vaccination was required. When my boyfriend arrived at the airport, he was denied boarding onto his plane. He is not vaccinated, but was able to provide the negative test. This was no longer sufficient. This caused numerous issues and loss of funds for both of us, throughout my entire trip. When we contacted customer service regarding the refund, we were told that he would not be issued one! I am just besides myself at the unwillingness to help us due to the circumstances. This is completely ridiculous. Not only was this of no fault of ours, we also purchased the Travel Protection Plan! We were still told that he has been listed as a “No Show” and our situation doesn’t fit into the policy for any of the refund guidelines. I understand that times are strange, and restrictions change almost daily (why we purchased the protection plan). I can’t believe this company is profiting off of passengers who have already been inconvenienced tremendously, at no fault of their own. We are being forced to pay for a series of flights that were never taken, refused a refund for the because of what? The airline wasn’t inconvenienced at all. The airline lost no money by him not being on the flight. This is terrible business, extremely unethical and terrible treatment of a customer. I will never fly Icelandair ever again.

Global rental car requires a deposit to rent a vehicle and buried in the fine print, you do not get back the deposit no matter how soon you cancel (in our case, three months in advance and only days after booking the rental). We canceled due to the awfully negative reviews. There was no phone number to call and when you click on the cancellation button, you have no choice but to agree to an additional fee.

Please note that my daughter and son in law needed to return specifically on May 19, 2020 as they have 2 small children and can not be away from them additional days aside the 4 originally planned. Interjet is now wanting them to return 2 days later with no other options. The return date is not an option. I called Expedia today and they advised that they are not able to issue a refund. I then asked for a credit and they were willing to do so. However they want to issue the credit in my daughter and son in laws name. I explained that I paid for the tickets and wanted the credit in my name as I travel more. Bottom line that I paid for them and they are able to see this. The supervisor from Expedia then called Interjet and asked for an exception. Reminder that Interject changed my plans, not me. The manager at Interjet said that they could not issue a refund but he would be willing to issues the credits in my name for a fee of $118.00 each ticket. Yes that’s right! Interjet will not give me a refund for a flight they changed. Interjet will however give me credit for an additional fee even though they initiated the change. I believe my request is reasonable. I’d like a refund but if it’s not an option why not give the person credit who paid for the tickets. The supervisor recommended that I do a chargeback with my bank however this is not a fraudulent situation nor am I disputing the charge. I’m asking for the 2 credits to be issued in my name as my daughter and son in law will not be able to travel those dates nor use a voucher in the next 12 months. It’s so hard to wrap my mind around the thought of the airline not wanting to be more flexible in times like this. Our condo was canceled and most business are closed in Puerto Vallarta. There is no reason to travel there now was it’s unsafe and too soon to expect everything is ‘normal’.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,5/1/2019,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dallas,Puerto Vallarta,TRUE,Mexico,FALSE,International

After a very long time we were able to have the written documents of the loss, and they told us in writing about what to do and who to contact in case we didn’t received information about the lost luggage after 5 days. Well, this is when the nightmare started, we tried to call all the numbers that were available on the notice, but no agent ever answered, only a robot that for many days kept telling us that they were still looking for our luggage, in the same time we tried to send also emails to the email address provided on the denounce document but we received right away the reply stating that the inbox was full and that nobody could read our email, you can imagine our frustration, we had some gift for the kids and my wife’s clothes, we kept calling but no answers and at this point 10 days of our vacation were gone, after that the robot that used to answer stated that the luggage was been found and that was sent to Malpensa, to the lost and found office.l I was super excited they found our luggage, and when finally I was able to talk to a real agent this agent told me that the luggage was not there, at that time my frustration came out and started complaining about the service I was receiving and and at that time the agent answered me “I wasn’t supposed to even answer your call” and hung up.

Their website forwards to Alitalia, so unless the website language is set to Italian, the transaction does not go through. During one attempt, I was charged to my credit card, despite the transaction on their website showing an error for “time out”. It took about three hours to figure out how to pay for seat selections and checked bags. When it came time to check in, I noticed that my seat selection I had paid USD 75 was not applied to my ticket, so called the help desk. After waiting on hold for what felt like an eternity, I was told there was nothing they could do, as the plane was full, so to email their complaints team for a refund. I did that over a week ago now and have received no response, so just filed a dispute with my credit card. I then found out that the airline doesn’t participate in TSA Pre-Check, so had to wait over an hour at security even though I have Global Entry (which includes TSA Pre-Check) for the specific reason of avoiding long security queues. Once boarded, I intended to use the WiFi do work for business purposes in order to not fall behind, but soon discovered the WiFi was not functioning and did not function throughout the entirety of the flight. Meals were small and insufficient in frequency. We were served two small meals once the course of the 12-hour flight. Snacks were kept at the rear of the plane, and given how many passengers frequented the snack bar, it would seem many people agreed with my sentiments.

They refused to give my 4 year old and snacks or ice cream that they passed out to every person on the plane. Their excuse was that she ordered a special meal so she couldn’t get anything else. Well everyone else on that plane that ordered a special meal still got many snacks and ice cream. The “special “ meal was absolutely disgusting. I wouldn’t have given it to an animal. It was not distinguishable in any way and they gave her fish with cheese sauce as the “bland meal” along with raw onion and pepper salad. The flight attendants also didn’t serve her any drinks without me having to almost berate them. They said no one was allowed to switch seats and I couldn’t trade with my husband up in business either, yet the man sitting right next to me was given the bulk head seat alone with no one next to him after our flight took off.

The plane and lavatories were clean; the on-flight personnel, the utmost in being pleasant and professional. One flight attendant in particular, Cindy from Singapore, chatted with me about Singapore for a minute and wished me safe and enjoyable travels to that city. Something else: I got up and went to the toilet, and came back only to find my neck pillow missing (I'm convinced that some passenger stole it. Who does that, steal a nondescript black neck pillow?!) At any rate, I disembarked the plane after landing at Narita; right before walking out of the jetway, I still wanted to try to at least make one more effort to find that neck pillow.

The flight from Boston to Tokyo was scheduled to depart in the middle of a blizzard. Unfortunately, this created some problems regarding preparing the aircraft. We eventually boarded (very quickly, as is Japan Airlines' custom). We then had to wait for a while as our plane was de-iced. We ended up leaving Boston about two hours late. However, the pilots were able to make up for one of those hours in the air, so that we only arrived about one hour late in Tokyo. Another passenger was concerned about making his connecting flight in Tokyo. A flight attendant calmly explained that he would have enough time and that they would hold the flight for him if necessary. This turned out to be unnecessary, as, to my shock, the staff at Narita basically just allowed all arriving passengers with connecting international flights to go directly into the gate area without first clearing security. This was truly a godsend and ensured that people really did make their connecting flights. And since gates weren't supposed to close until just 10 minutes before departure, this meant they did not even have to hold planes for people! As for the inflight experience, it was similar to my experiences from Manila to Boston, except that there was no last-minute snack service just before arriving in Tokyo. Instead, they offered us sweet buns midway through the flight. Again, we were served a full meal on the flight from Boston to Tokyo and on the flight from Tokyo to Manila, as well as a light meal towards the end of the flight from Boston to Tokyo. And once again, with the exception of the full meal from Boston to Tokyo, there were no choices for the meals-there was only one option. However, as usual, all of the food was truly superb. Because I was flying during a different month from my previous flights with Japan Airlines, I noticed they removed from their entertainment system a movie I had begun watching previously and had hoped to finish watching during this trip.

Your company really needs to learn a few things about customer relations before you become an international airline company. Despite paying an additional $200 luggage fee they still lost my bag. This happened on 5th January 2019. I was told I would be reimbursed for my expenses as I didn’t have a single piece of clothing as a result of their negligence. After having purchased the bare necessities I provided them with the bills that I was going to need, I was told the matter would be resolved no later than the 17th January, but it wasn’t. When I called on the 18th I was given a date of the 23rd for the same and then the 28th. They just keep going round in circles.

Our flight was supposed to be about 2 1/2 hours from Seattle to LAX. After arriving at our gate we learned that our flight had been delayed by 2 hours. Ok, no big deal. Then another 2 hours, and then again and again. Our flight was delayed for more than 10 hours. After speaking to the gate agent 2 different times, we, and everyone else were told the plane had a mechanical issue and would arrive asap. Everyone was also told they would be issued a $200 credit for the delay per Jet Blue policy. The gate agent said we would receive an email regarding this credit. Nobody was happy about the delay, but at least we would be compensated, or so we thought. After several days without an email about the credit we were promised I called Jet Blue customer service. I was told that we were not entitled to any compensation because our 10 hour delay was weather related. How convenient. Their compensation policy doesn't cover weather delays. I already knew weather delays weren't covered after reading their policy during our delay. I asked where the plane was coming from and they said LAX. What weather delays does LAX have in July? I explained to them that a result of this delay my family lost an entire day of our vacation and lost our car rental since we arrived after hours. Why do Jet Blue gate agents tell us all it was a mechanical issue with the plane (covered under their compensation policy) and promise everyone compensation, then Jet Blue doesn't follow through? Sounds like a bait and switch. Customer service offered us a $75 credit to each of us as a ""courtesy"". I declined the credit because this isn't about a dollar amount for me.

I faced three main problems: 1) After a few days of booking, I was informed by JetBlue that my direct flight had been canceled. They also assigned me a new flight which was several hours earlier than my actual departure time from Boston. I contacted the JetBlue helpline and requested to book another flight (the only option for June 10), which wasn’t direct (rather Boston to Florida to Atlanta). 2) During the online boarding process on June 05 and 10, I had to choose a check-in baggage option and was informed that my credit card would not be charged if I had already paid for check-in baggage. I followed the same process on my return flight from Boston to Atlanta. But my credit card was charged $35 for my Atlanta to Boston trip. After a few days, when I looked at my credit card summary, I contacted JetBlue for a refund. They said they would process my request in the next ten days. But contacting JetBlue support was a very frustrating process: wait time was 45 minutes, and it took me over an hour to report the matter to a JetBlue crewmember. 3) The most important and frustrating thing I experienced on June 10 when returning from Boston to Atlanta. The good thing was that JetBlue informed me that I must leave early for the airport because there was some construction work going on in Boston City; therefore, commuting to Boston airport may take longer than usual. My flight was scheduled for 3:45 PM. Therefore, I left for the airport at 12:00 PM. But when I reached the airport, I learned that the departure was delayed for around 35 minutes. The flight kept on delaying, and finally, I learned that I would not be able to catch my 2nd JetBlue flight from Florida to Atlanta if I flew by the original flight from Boston to Florida. I approached the JetBlue helpdesk at Boston Airport. After more than 90 minutes of waiting, I talked to the help desk official. He issued me a new direct ticket (Boston to Atlanta) for the next day. Upon asking, they informed me that I could book a hotel for up to $250. I booked a hotel for an overnight stay in Boston and spent around $240 (I didn’t eat dinner). Then I contacted JetBlue and sent them the invoice. After ten days, I was informed by JetBlue that I was not eligible for reimbursement because the flight was delayed due to the weather.

Jetblue Airways,2,"""experiences left much to be desired""","I recently had the opportunity to fly with JetBlue airlines on two separate occasions, and my experiences left much to be desired. While I appreciate that delays can happen, the level of inconvenience I faced on both my outbound and return flights was simply unacceptable. During my initial journey, my flight was delayed for four hours, causing significant disruption to my travel plans. This unexpected delay left me frustrated and feeling as though my time was not valued by the airline. I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, but the lack of clear communication and assistance from the JetBlue staff compounded my disappointment. However, my dissatisfaction reached new heights when my return flight was delayed for five hours. The reason provided for this prolonged delay was particularly disheartening: the pilot was allegedly stuck in traffic. It is perplexing to think that such a vital member of the flight crew would not have contingencies in place to avoid traffic-related mishaps. This incident gave rise to concerns about the airline's organizational preparedness and overall professionalism. While I acknowledge that flight delays can occur across the industry, the recurrence of such extensive delays with JetBlue has left a lasting impression. The overall lack of transparency and efficiency in handling these situations left me questioning the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction. I must mention, however, that once the flights finally took off, the onboard experience was pleasant. The flight attendants were courteous and attentive, and the in-flight amenities provided a comfortable journey. However, these positive aspects were overshadowed by the significant inconveniences and frustrations I encountered at the start of both trips. In conclusion, my experiences with JetBlue airlines left me disappointed and hesitant to choose their services in the future. While the onboard experience was commendable, the recurring and excessively long delays I faced at the beginning of my trips, including a delay of five hours due to a pilot stuck in traffic, greatly overshadowed any positive aspects.

Jetblue Airways,1,"""later deny us a refund""","My wife and I arrived at the airport 90 minutes in advance, and the flight was delayed 30 minutes, so we ended up 2 hours early. The lines for baggage drop-off were out the door. We used a JetBlue kiosk to purchase two bag tags to check two of our bags; it charged us for two but only printed out one. We were told by a JetBlue employee to go to the kiosk help desk line to address the issue: there were two snaking lines of maybe 20-30 people each, manned by just two employees, and they were moving at the rate of one customer every 10-15 minutes. Were we to wait in that line, we almost certainly were going to miss our flight. So, we elected to use a second kiosk to purchase a bag tag for our second bag in the hopes this one would work; it didn't, but it took our money (again). So, rather than jump from kiosk to kiosk, paying more and more money in the hope that one would work, which is unreasonable, we were forced to wait in line. By the time we reached the front, the JetBlue employee told us that we were going to miss our flight and that, in addition, the flight was ""overbooked,"" so they were going to have to ""rebook"" or ""cancel."" She searched for other flights that day, including through JetBlue, its partner American Airlines, and non-partner airlines; the earliest available flight was July 1. It was the morning of June 28, we had just moved out of our apartment and shipped our stuff to LA, and we were scheduled to move into our new LA apartment that same day, so we would have had to pay for food and lodging for the interval period in Boston--a hefty price--rather than stay in our new paid-for apartment in LA. We explained this to the JetBlue employee, who said that she would cancel our flight and issue a refund for our tickets and bags. I requested confirmation that this would be to our original payment method; she confirmed it would be. There was only one more flight in the entire Boston region that had capacity to take us to LA before July 1: a flight leaving in two hours out of Providence. My wife and I booked the flight, quickly compared taxi and rideshare prices, discovered the difference was negligible, and took an Uber to the airport in Providence, where we successfully boarded the last flight to LA. We later discovered that we had been deceived by the JetBlue employee at the kiosk help desk in Boston; she did NOT issue any refund and instead wrote in her ""notes"" that my wife and I were ""late"" to check in our bags, which was a complete lie and clearly intended to create a fabricated, falsified paper trail to later deny us a refund. We could not check in our bags because JETBLUE'S kiosks were defective, but that didn't matter to JetBlue's customer ""service"" representatives. The fact that we were told the flight was overbooked even though it apparently wasn't didn't matter to JetBlue's customer ""service"" representatives.  We had to fight for hours over the phone to even get our bags refunded; we're still on the hook for the tickets according to JetBlue's ""policy.""",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,6/1/2023,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Boston,Los Angeles,TRUE,United States,TRUE,Domestic

Jetblue Airways,1,"""beyond ridiculous to be charged even more""","JetBlue cancelled our flight to Fort Myers, FL minutes before we were to leave for the airport. I followed instructions to switch flights online, and when I did so, found that the next flight to Fort Myers was 2 days out. To travel the same day, I was forced to take a flight to nearby Tampa, FL instead. I was charged an additional $320 to do this. However, in the ""Flights Cancelled by JetBlue"" section of the ""Delays, Cancellations, and Schedule Changes"" page on the website (https://www.jetblue.com/help/delays-and-cancellations), it states that I should be able to switch to another flight at no charge if JetBlue cancelled. I contacted them through their website to request a refund, which was denied on the grounds that they claim that I willfully elected to fly to a different city - this is a completely ridiculous claim, since they cancelled the flight, and the next flight to the same city was multiple days out. No other flights were cancelled or delayed at all that day, indicating no staffing issues. There was no inclement weather on either end. This implies that they must have cancelled because not enough people were on the flight, so it was no longer profitable. It's concerning that US-based airlines are allowed to do this with flights at the last possible minute. As if JetBlue hasn't already jerked me around enough: 5 weeks after the flight, I got an email from them saying I was ""undercharged"" for services offered, and they're going to charge me even more this coming week. It was aggravating enough to be refused a refund, but beyond ridiculous to be charged even more well over a month after the cancelled flight.

I’m a laid-back person and can deal with lost bags, delayed flights, and less-than-ideal hubs, but when it’s employees consistently seem angry and look down upon their clients, I cannot help but use another service. During my last trip, there was a system malfunction that swapped my flight out and upon calling the service, they were beyond unreasonable in lending assistance for an issue that was their fault in the first place. Another experience that has left me feeling disrespected and disappointed. I am officially done with JetBlue. I hope this serves as a warning to others who may be considering their services.

Meanwhile, at the gate next to us, 2 aircrafts scheduled for West Palm Beach, Fl (1 left at approximately 9 and the other boarding at approximately 11) seemed to have no problem. The desk attendants finally let us know that the aircraft was having mechanical issues and that they were working on it. We tried to get on another flight but were told that we would not be able to get our luggage and that West Palm Beach was more than an hour away from Miami. We had to contact the transportation/cruise line to cancel our trip. This was extremely disappointing and heartbreaking.

Which means we missed our connecting flight. Then they rebooked us taking a completely different route to our final destination (JFK instead of FLL), which was then delayed and delayed and delayed, making the connecting flight a problem once again. We spend HOURS and HOURS on support with them, trying to get everything situated. We missed out on about $1000 in resort time that we had paid for, not including our time, gas, and other things we had to pay for. And JetBlue's response? Too bad, so sad.

I tried the site and filling it out twice but the site was not working.

They thought what happened to me was insane and did not understand why the San Jose Airport/Jet Blue demanded I have that and almost denied me getting on that plane.

Kenya Airways,1,"""vow to never fly KA again""","This review is regarding Kenya Airways customer service and has nothing to do with the details of a specific flight. Our return to Chicago was cancelled when the KA pilots went on strike. My family of four was left to arrange alternate flight arrangements by ourselves and our travel agent who was back in Chicago. We absolutely received no help from anyone at KA. Finally got economy class tickets with Turkish Air which we took from Nairobi to Istanbul and home to Chicago. Had to pay for those tickets and was told to wait for a refund of the return with KA for our cancelled business class tickets. As it turned out, we had to wait a while for our refund which finally arrived on Feb 27. The refund was issued for almost $1200 each ($4800 for the four of us). While this may sound fair, please consider that we paid a total of $14,647 for our four business class round trip tickets to Nairobi and back. Additionally, we had to pay for our return via Turkish Air at a total of $6356. So the refund represented less than 1/3rd of the cost of the original round trip tickets. We were hoping for some consideration of the cost we incurred with Turkish Air, which ultimately was caused by KA. Following a recommendation from the CEO of KA I was contacted by one of his subordinates. While, I do believe that this individual may have had some impact upon the processing of the refund, I disagreed with him on numerous occasions when he and his staff tried to explain the refund policy to me following disruptions in service. The following is a direct quote from his email to regarding these situations: “In the event of disruptions such as the strike, the airline makes arrangements to carry you at the earliest opportunity on one of our scheduled services or reroute you to the destination shown on the ticket by our own services or those of another carrier at no additional cost to you. Should the alternative flights not be suitable or we are unable to rebook you to an alternate flight, you are entitled to a refund of the value of the unused portion of your tickets.” I contended to him that neither myself nor any member of my family was approached by anyone from KA to reroute us OR that anybody at the KA desk was willing to assist us make alternate flight arrangements. I was particularly incensed when I read the words in red, stating “…at no additional cost to you.” I feel lied to and disrespected by Kenya Airways in their addressing our significant and inconvenient disruption of service. I have found examples of other travelers on our flight similarly affected by the strike who had desk clerks reroute them with no additional out of pocket expenditure. The positive feelings I had about Kenya Airways prior to leaving Africa have been replaced by a lack of trust, a vow to never fly KA again, and to pursue informing all travelers I can to be aware and leery of KA’s management of refunds and its ultimate care and respect for passengers.",Family Leisure,Business Class,10/1/2022,Satisfied,Satisfied,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Dissatisfied,New York,Nairobi,TRUE,Kenya,FALSE,International

Kenya Airways,8,"""Good value for money – will fly with them again""","Monrovia to Kigali through Accra and Nairobi 19-20 May 2022. The 2 aircrafts were both B737-800s in very good condition. I had to change my departure dates and it took me only 10 minutes online - and was even free as it was a “Business Light” ticket. All flights were on time. Checked in online. Monrovia Airport is full of hustlers pretending to be from the airline but want tips and they are annoying, the airline should chase them away. Kenya Airways (KQ) uses a third party lounge in Monrovia which is small but good with courteous, proactive attendants. No champagne, but plenty of drinks and liquor. The local Club beer is good. Embarking easy, fast, not a single crosscheck from lounge to seat – what a pleasure. Onboard, welcome drinks were served. The seats were huge and well bolstered, reclining, new, and very comfortable. Could sleep. IFE or WiFi was only working on the last leg. No printed menus were given out, but the FAs asked each individual on food choices. My pre-ordered special sea food meals were all different, delicious, and served without reminders. Business Class was full after Accra, but I did neither feel cramped nor stuffy. FAs, all Kenyans, were good and caring – though maybe not world class. In NBO the Pride lounge did the job for me during the 12 hours’ layover. The last stretch to Kigali was with IFE onboard, champagne, and my beloved seafood hot meal, which KQ still offers (even in economy) in contrast to Qatar and Emirates who have stopped this service at is it not qualifying as “dietary reasons” to order.

Kenya Airways,3,"""charge-back process to recover this fee""","We flew from JFK to NBO just before the pandemic was declared. This was the first leg of a journey to Seychelles (SEZ). We found the cabin crew on this flight to be excellent, attentive, and really friendly. It seemed that the cabin staff were up and down the aisles very frequently and had a smile on their faces, something that must be tough during these times. We told them how pleased we were at the end of the flight and they seemed genuinely surprised to get the positive feedback. We passed this on to the airline via their website but have received no response as yet. Check in at JFK was easy, but probably atypical due to the reduced number of flyers in early March this year. The same could be said for the boarding process. The plane itself was new, a lovely 787 with mood lighting and big windows. The legroom was reasonable (not cramped but not luxurious). Overall it was comfortable for such a long journey. The food on the outbound journey was really good, way better than we expected, and our son' child's meal was also better than typical kids meals. The biggest negative on our outbound journey was the entertainment system. There were very few recent movies and the choice was extremely limited. Take your tablet or phone and download some eBooks, movies or other entertainment to it. if you are expecting to use the system on the plane to keep you occupied for 14 hours you will be disappointed. If I was rating the airline based on this flight I would actually give this flight 4 or even 5 stars as it was enjoyable but external factors are influencing that rating. Our return journey from Seychelles was delayed overnight by 14 hours and we had to fight to get accommodation. Due to this delay, and the Kenyan government ban on entry for foreigners due to COVID-19, it also meant our mini KQ Safari booked through the airline had to be cancelled. This is all very understandable and we have no issue with any of that. We cancelled this over email with the safari division while in the Seychelles and assumed there would be no issue. However, despite meeting 3 of the criteria needed for refund I am now going through a VISA charge-back process to recover this fee. First they say to talk to travel agent (when we booked the safari directly through them on a different credit card number) and then they say its valid for a year and they do not refund services .. despite having a clear statement on their website that a refund can be done if you fit 1 of the 3 criteria - 1. contact the email provided within 24 hours of the safari to cancel (we did it 6 days before), 2. Have a flight cancellation or delay (we were cancelled and put on a flight 14 hours later), and 3. Being denied entry to the country (the government were denying foreign nationals even with a visa - which we had). We want to go back to the Seychelles when all this is over but sadly I fear it will need to be with another airline, despite the stellar service of the staff on KQ003 on the day we flew.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,3/1/2020,Neutral,Very Satisfied,Satisfied,Neutral,Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,New York,Seychelles,TRUE,Seychelles,FALSE,International

The trouble began when we were about to board a connecting flight at JFK in New York City: the flight from Amsterdam to Cardiff was cancelled literally 30 minutes before we boarded the flight out to Amsterdam. We were held at the gate while they rebooked everything, and we nearly missed our flight. The flight to Amsterdam was rough: we wanted to sleep, but there were very loud passengers behind us, and they wouldn't be quiet for a minute. Once in Amsterdam, we were routed to Edinburgh in Scotland, then flown to Cardiff on Loganair. We were told we might have additional baggage fees, but we lucked out and this didn't happen. We got to Cardiff about five hours late, and we were exhausted by then. We had to fly back on KLM, and the fun started again. The plane was held up on the tarmac in Cardiff after they realized the plane was leaking deicer fluid from the wings, and we sat there in a hot plane for about 90 minutes while a technician tried to fix it. At one point, they announced the plane would not be able to fly. However, they were able to fix it somehow, so we weren't forced to get rebooked for another flight and spend hours waiting around Cardiff. The flight from Amsterdam to Dulles in D.C. was relatively harmless, although I found the flight attendant we had rather rude. She lectured me at one point because I had put some trash in a plastic water bottle. Finally, we made it back to D.C. and through passport control. And we started waiting for our luggage on the carousel, and we waited and waited for one large bag, because, as it turned out, it had been left behind in Amsterdam. So, we had to file a claim and wait two more days until our bag finally showed up. My wife was taking another trip and only had a day to do laundry afterward. I wasn't impressed overall.

On one single trip, we were rebooked 5 times on inward and outward flights and only after writing angry messages were we offered a normal alternative to a new flight that included two 6 hours layovers, which was supposed to have none. No food vouchers offered, you have to force them to do everything and therefore force you to become an annoying passenger for the unfortunate ground personell. Last but not least, our last flight was delayed by two hours and the only offered option instead of our actual transfer flight was to stay at the airport for 10 hours, again no offers of food or lounge without going to the counter and waiting in line for an hour. What took the crown was that our automatically rebooked flights and human rebooked flights were all still in the system with no tickets reissued. That meant that we were unable to check in, unable to reserve seats, unable to get the seats we payed for and altogether made it impossible for the lady at the counter to understand what was going on without calling KLM directly. The only thing they cared about at the gate was upgrading passengers that wanted to pay extra. They all had priority over the bunch of people with no seats.  Premium prices for budget service.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,2,"""service I received was atrocious""","I had a horrible experience flying KLM from Houston to Amsterdam and back again. When I arrived to the check in gate in Houston I was told that I had been downgraded from Premium Comfort to Economy because of a change in aircraft and that my baggage allowance had changed. I had packed my bags the night before and then woken up early to drive 3 hours to Houston to catch the flight. Needless to say, I wasn't willing to throw any of my luggage in the trash. I told them there wasn't any way that I would have had time to re-pack my bags (now noticing that I had received an email at 3 am notifying me of the downgrade.) After much discussion I was finally permitted to take all my luggage with me. The rudeness and lack of understanding at the counter was disgusting. On the plane the staff were perfectly friendly. However, somehow in the downgrade process my meal plan had been erased. I have a severe allergy but thankfully the attendant was very kind and helpful in finding me something I could eat. On the return flight I had the opposite problem - my meal plan had resurfaced but the food I'm allergic to was very present in the dish. I notified the staff that I had an allergy and was there anything else I could possibly eat? I'm not picky, I just don't particularly want to break out in hives. She very begrudgingly searched around until she found something but she wasn't happy, saying that I had requested a specific meal. I acknowledged her, and said yes I had, but the ingredients aren't listed when I select it and - I have an allergy. For the next meal she brought me the dish again, with the food I'm allergic to, and smiled when she handed it to me. Oh joy. The smile on her face made me stare at the food in disbelief in front of me. I accepted it and just didn't eat. How could she smile like that? I had submitted a request for the refund fare difference for the first flight and it was accepted but I was told that I needed to resubmit it again after all flights are finished. I guess because they can't keep track of it for a week? The service I received was atrocious. The red tape ridiculous. But they certainly know how to train their employees on board to be friendly, serving you your food allergy and all.

I had to call customer service to fix the issue. However, they were unable to sit our friend with us. We were excited about our journey so decided to just go with it. On our return flight, we were yet again split up and also downgraded. I had to spend another 3 hours on the phone trying to find solutions. No customer service reps wanted to help. I had to find the solution myself and we were still unable to get our friend with us. I was told to do the reimbursement online for the downgrade. So I did and it was rejected. More phone calls to customer service. I asked for supervisors but was told the reps do not have supervisors. No managers to assist them. I was told it was rejected because I didn't submit proof. Is information not stored at KLM? I asked for the reps email so I can send proof. Apparently reps do not have company emails so I cant email the rep now. I submitted proof and was told I would get some points back. I was given 68k points for my troubles. 68k?! Can I even book a premium economy flight for 2 for that? During this process I have spent approximately 8 hours on the phone and been ""disconnected"" four times without a return call. It seems KLM just ignores the customer in hopes they go away.

We expected to pay $100 for each of our second checked bags because that's what the website says. However, we found out while checking the bags that they only allow 10kg per carry on bag.  So we ended up having to pay and extra $200 each (on top of the expected $100 each) to check our second carry-on bags since they were both over 10kg. I have never had an airline weigh my carry-ons before. We gave them our credit cards and then once they checked our bags, they told us we had to go to a different counter to pick up our cards. We went there and proceeded to wait for 45 minutes while they tried to charge our cards. There was no one waiting in front of us. It literally took them 4 staff members and 45 minutes to swipe 2 credit cards. They finally told us they would waive one of the $200 charges. We gladly accepted this and left to board. I found out later that they did actually charge us that $200 even though they said they wouldn't.

This was my 7th flight on Korean Air - and all of this started on a very speedy, no-nonsense check-in process at Honolulu International Airport. The immigration checks were quick, and after a short bite, I went to the gate 2.5 hours before departure time. The boarding gate staffs were overall great - so does the cabin crews. I was welcomed in a friendly way. Upon reaching my seat, I figured out that my seat was comfortable in terms of legroom, with tons of features, but the seats were quite firm and hard, and there were several kid stickers that the cleaning crew had missed. Not a big deal for me. Throughout the entire flight, the crew kept on being friendly to me - they asked everything, even asking me if I have ever tried Bibimbap before - my 1st meal for the flight, which tasted very good. The 2nd meal of mine served before landing was beef with rice, which tasted good, but the meal presentation made me deny the 5-star rating. By this point, the crews were still very friendly but they couldn't hide the tiredness they had after the 9-hour journey (which is normal). The biggest blow of the flight was the IFE - hence why I didn't give this flight a 10/10. The IFE, for me, won in terms of responsiveness and layout, but the contents were very lacking, especially the movie section and music, with most of them being 13+ or 16+ contents, with only a few contents that were appropriate to be accessed by everyone. The saving grace of the IFE was the game sections and the onboard camera facility. Actual departure and landing time were pretty on time. In conclusion - apart from the IFE (which, according to their social media sites, has been renovated), this flight was one of the best (well, in fact, the best!) flights I've ever taken in 2019, with the crew becoming the shining stars of this flight.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,6/1/2019,Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Neutral,Dissatisfied,Honolulu,Seoul-Incheon,TRUE,South Korea,FALSE,International

I repeatedly observed them being very friendly and all smiles towards Korean passengers, however, the treatment towards non-Korean passengers was different. I believe this is because they felt more obliged to be courteous towards their local passengers. The biggest complaint I have though is the food. Food portions were terribly small and mostly tasteless. Halfway through the flight, I ate a sandwich which I purchased at the airport and flight attendant told me I was not allowed to eat outside food.

American was adamant this is a Korean ticket and only they can release to change. BTW, 2 kids under 5 that had been up since 4 am, so we were not in the mood to run around the airport. Chicago transfer agent K20 gate, wouldn’t let us transfer, so had to go out of security to get to terminal 5. So took the bus, with whole family in tow, to terminal 5. The Korean Air agents used very polite words to say it wasn’t their problem, they would not help and the best they could do was standby for tomorrow and since the flight was full, very unlikely to go tomorrow. That was the last straw. Helping me to resolve the problem is the job of the Korean Air service counter team, when I bought tickets from their company. The utter lack of caring or willingness to do anything amazed me. Korean Air lost a customer for life today. I had used Korean air for last 10+ years at least 2-3 round trips Asia a year.

Korean Air,3,"""nickel and dime culture""","Los Angeles to Chiang Mai via Seoul. We decided to spend a little bit more for our flight to Thailand in exchange for a better service and were disappointed: We could have saved several hundreds of dollars if we had used a Chinese budget airline. What was good about Korean Air were the flight attendants who were super friendly and helpful, on our return flight to LAX they even carried my carry on bag for me, when they saw that I was holding our baby. The reason why we won't fly with Korean Air anymore: I had ordered a ""vegetarian oriental meal"" (not vegan, but vegetarian which isn't as restrictive) What I received was a joke: it looked like someone had emptied half a can of peas into the aluminum container and thrown some bok choi leaves on top. No sauce, tofu, rice or potatoes. Horrible. My wife was still hungry after her meal and asked for a snack. The answer was: ""we don't carry any snacks"" (contrary to what their website says: ""Snack Service A wide variety of snacks, such as samgak kimbop, cup ramen, pizza, and makkoli rice cakes, are served on long flights."" The flight attendant explained: ""we stopped offering cup ramen because of the smell"" when my wife told him that she used to get ramen on previous flights.  I had one can of beer at the beginning of the flight and ordered a gin tonic several hours later. This drink spilled because my table was defective (the kind which you pull out from the armrest). When I asked for another drink they watered it down and advised me ""this is your last drink, each passenger is allowed to have only 3 drinks"". I was not the slightest little bit drunken and very surprised because even on low budget airlines like Air India nobody told me how many drinks I could have. This is obviously a policy which is supposed to save the airline money.  We both started to get a headache because of dehydration. When I asked for water, the flight attendant poured approximately 4 table spoons into a cup, I went back and forth several times between our seats and the pantry and each time they filled the cup only 50%. We were both thirsty during the entire flight. Before departure there was a bottle of water on each seat and as soon as the boarding was completed, they hurried to collect the water bottles from the vacant seats. (Probably in order to lock them up in the safe...) 5.) We had purchased an inflatable pillow which was specifically designed for air travel. As soon as my wife started to inflate the pillow, several flight attendants approached us saying that we were not allowed to use it.  Obviously Korean Air's management made decisions in order to save money and we felt this nickel and dime culture during the entire trip.

There are few positives throughout the journey, but more negative aspects, will make me think twice before choosing this career again. Aircraft is brand new, maintained in pristine condition. Online checkin experience can be better, no clear steps of how to proceed. First time users, good luck with the process. but won’t complaint. Checkin at the airport was quick and can’t expect anything more. Boarding process can be improved, as there were no clear instructions for the lines. People were impatient and it was a mess. I was traveling JFK-Kuwait-Chennai (KU118). On time flight left the gate, probably since it’s weekend and peak hours we were taxiing for more than 30 mins. This delayed the departure quite badly. Snacks served right after take off, food was very good. Snack and Brunch menu have many options for vegetarians and kids as well. Crew were very friendly and was available to help the needy people. In my flight onboard WiFi was available. It is not free and it’s pay per use. $10-30mins, $20-60mins, $40-180mins. -Kuwait International airport, very unorganized arrival security and transit procedures. One staff handling the entire crowd and verifying the boarding pass. Airport have free WiFi, can be used to get in touch with dear ones. Transit, airport is under construction. You need to find the way around things and figure out on your own. Transit lounges are available, if there is a bigger layover (my case flight delayed by 3hours) you should use the facility. It’s free and has lot of seats. Connection flight, boarding again another chaos. Until last minute no clear information about the boarding gates. Once announced (literally one ground staffed shouted, no proper PA system) all the people came running to the gates. Could have been organized better. Since everyone came in random order, it took lot of time to settle down. Baggage, it could be the time of the day, but almost took one hour for collecting the bags. With the lean crowd, officials were not organized and bags in random order. Overall I will not recommend this carrier for family trips, if you are alone and want an adventurous trip then go for it.

We had already reserved a seat online while booking, but when boarding, the agent suddenly changed my seat and my parents seats. We got in the plane, and then 30 mins later a flight attendant asked us if we can switch our seats with this guy who had children. Apparently she can’t seat children by the exit, and that’s fine. But this needed to be sorted out by the airline beforehand. Most importantly, the meals are based by the seat numbers. So when we changed seats like 2 times, we almost got the wrong meals. We had to tell the flight attendant our selected meal preference during the booking, otherwise we would’ve received the wrong meals. I mean it’s a service we paid for. The food was decent though.  It was an alright flight for the price of the tickets. However, I’d probably avoid this airline if I could.

I did not have a single flight with Kuwait, either on my way to Dubai or back that was on time. From JFK, my flight was delayed for 3 hours, causing me to miss my connection to Dubai.

They are rude, and the airport lacks proper signage. You are bussed around from terminal to terminal with no real staff presence to guide you. We almost missed our flight to JFK because the gate was labeled Mumbai, so we didn't know that it was intended for New York. Kuwait Airport doesn't even seem qualified to be a domestic airport, lacking proper signage and two distant terminals which you're bussed around in. Ground crew does not care about you, and show no interest or courtesy when dealing with you. The same can be said with the cabin crew. They are rude, and do not know how to treat passengers. The meal timings are horrible, as they leave many passengers extremely hungry for long hours on the plane, and water service is extremely selective. You'd think an airline knows when to give out water and food. They also gave us no details about our stop in Shannon on our way back to JFK and could not be seen for much of the flight.

I was unsure what to expect. The check-in was a breeze at JFK and the agent said it was a light flight with about 35-40% load factor. That was surprising being just a day before Eid. Boarding was easy, and the aircraft pushed back 15 min before schedule. JFK-KWI flight, the aircraft very clean and seats comfortable. Legroom was fantastic. I managed to get a window seat and had all the three seats to myself. Rather almost everyone in the aft cabin had 3 seats to themselves. Individual TV screen was very responsive with a decent collection of programming. The crew was friendly and courteous. Menus, blanket, and basic amenity pouch handed out. Food was ok but can improve in quality. Was concerned about the short 45 min connection in Kuwait, but the flight arrived about an hour early. Kuwait airport is medieval and dirty with a few coffees and duty-free shops. Security checks are not centralized but occur at each gate leading to long lines and delays. My KWI-DXB flight (B 777-300 ER) was packed and was delayed more than an hour due to long lines at gate security. The short flight was uneventful and were handed out in a takeaway Iftar meal boxes. So, an in all a rather good flight. Return leg: DXB-KWI (A320) was short and uneventful with breakfast boxes handed out. KWI-JFK via Shannon was painful with an 85% load. Long security lines at the gate in Kuwait. One of the Kuwaiti pax who I chatted with was like - this flight is always delayed. Multiple security checks and verifications. Lotta connecting passengers mostly from South Asia and some of them didn’t know the flight had a stopover at Shannon. Lunch served, and amenity kits handed out. My choice of meal had run out but was nothing great. All pax deplaned at Shannon to go through multiple hellish security points and get back in about 2 hrs. It just gave time to stretch and use the toilets. Cabin crew was cheerful and courteous but I asked for blankets and was told none remain, however at the time of deplaning at JFK found an open overhead bin full of blankets.

LATAM Airlines,1,"""expected to pay for the airline's errors""","LATAM is unable to provide adequate support when it comes to flight changes or issues which leaves customers to fend for themselves or fork over a ton of cash to fix LATAM's problem. I do not recommend flying with LATAM if you will have multiple connections or if you're booking out far enough in advance that flight times, etc. might change because it will be nearly impossible to get your itinerary corrected. I purchased my flights directly through LATAM from SAN to LAX to SCL. When it came time to check in for my flight (18 hours before take off) I was unable to check in for my flight; it was impossible via the app and online. I called the LATAM support line and they were able to confirm that the error was an internal booking error (i.e. 100% LATAM's fault) which resulted in me not actually having a seat on the first flight. None of the four reps that I talked to (over four hours) could change the ticket or help me out. They told me that my options were to: 1) Cancel my ticket and be refunded, 2) I could pay to 'change' my flights, or 3) they could open a case and someone would call me eventually. A case was opened, however no one called me within the next 12 hours (at which point my flight was 6 hours from takeoff). I called them again (two hours this time) and confirmed with them what my options were and they confirmed that one of them was cancelling the ticket for a refund, so I told them that I wanted to get a refund for my ticket. Suddenly, this was no longer an option and the person couldn't explain why and also couldn't do anything else. The advice that the rep gave me was to ""be patient"" which I find unacceptable. They said I could 'try going to the connecting airport and check in there to see what happens,"" although they separately indicated that if I 'missed' my first flight then the entire trip would be cancelled. About an hour before my first flight was scheduled to take off, I got an email that said ""we tried to reach you"" to address the case however I had no missed calls and it had no instructions to get in touch with them again. I never received a follow up. Even if they had called, it would have been too late to make it to the airport for my flight on time (even if I was standing in the airport lobby when I answered the call) which is unacceptable.

Subsequently, the trip was cancelled by the tour company due to Covid. I called LATAM and was told that I could hold open my ticket until the next year. My tour was rescheduled for June 2021 and I rebooked flights on LATAM. The 2021 trip was also cancelled by the tour company due to Covid. I spoke by phone with a LATAM agent who told me my ticket would be held open until June 13, 2020. My tour was rescheduled by the tour company for June 2022. In early March 2022, I began trying to rebook my flights. This turned out to be an absolute nightmare and ultimately unsuccessful. I lost track of the number of attempts I made to rebook this ticket, but it had to be over 20. For about a week, I made several calls daily that resulted in waiting for extremely long times for my call to be answered, only to be cut off. I waited about a week before I started calling again. Now my calls were answered, but I couldn’t believe I was dealing with the same airline I had dealt with in 2020 and 2021. With one or two exceptions, every agent had such poor English that it was extremely difficult to communicate, I never really felt they understood what I wanted, and I, in turn, could barely understand them. Several times, I had to tell someone that I would just have to try another agent. The background noise level was extreme. I had to terminate several calls because it was impossible to hear. With one exception, the agents did not seem to know how to do their job.

Finally, I got an agent with good English on a clear line, who was able to book exactly what I wanted. When we were nearly finished, he put me on hold - and the call was dropped. That was when I gave up and bought tickets online. I had to book the SMF-LAX leg separately on another airline. I sent all the above information to the airline with my request for a refund of the $2198.09 I'd paid for the original ticket.

I showed the email with seats from LOT and no help. Then I go the boarding pass with TSA precheck. I could see fast track on it.

LOT Polish Airlines,1,"""do my best to never book LOT again!","I was traveling with my wife and 1.5-year-old baby. They delayed our flight by 30-minute increments, and never gave us a reason why. The original departure was supposed to be 4:30PM. At 9 PM, after 10 delays and 5 hours of waiting at the gate, they told us the plane would only leave the next day at noon / 12PM. We didn't stand in line for the complimentary hotel because we could stay at our friends close to the airport, but the people told us next day that it took 3+ hours, or until midnight. The following day at 9AM when we checked in they gave us food vouchers but none of the restaurants accepted it. We never asked for food vouchers so this seemed like such a strange thing to make us even more irritated.  The plane was set to leave at noon / 12PM but they kept delaying the flight again by 30-minute increments and we were close to rebooking to another flight (where the customer service rep said that they probably won't reimburse us for), but then they finally announced at 4PM that we're ready to board. After sitting for an extra 2 hours on the plane, we finally departed at 6PM. We arrived at our destination 24 hours late. A minor irritant: We asked to have our carry-on baggage checked in because we were with a baby and it's easier to traverse the airport without having to tow that around. The first day they said they won't because the plane isn't full. At the check-in gate an hour later I asked if the plane isn't full could they perhaps secure a whole row (3 seats) for my family so the baby could possibly sleep between us. There they said the plane is full. The following day when we checked in again we asked if they could check in our carry-ons as well and they did so, no questions asked. So the first day someone was either lying or just not willing to even try to help out. I called customer service when we got in to see if we could have our return flight changed to a week later and they said that they can only change it to a day later per policy, because that's how much the plane was delayed. But, the day later date had a 16-hour layover vs our original 2-hour layover so they offered to shorten our trip by a day if we'd like. And to make matters even more mind-boggling I checked online and the 1-day later flight was actually more expensive then the 1-week later flight. They'd give me a more expensive return flight because their policy doesn't let them give me a flight that's further out than the delay we experienced.  Other irritant: None of the tv remotes worked on the transatlantic flight, so I couldn't even turn on the light or do anything with it really. Final irritant: The seat I sat in reclined but didn't stay there. So every time I leaned forward to get my book or grab a drink, it came with me, and then I had to recline it again, irritating the person sitting behind me. All of this with a baby in tow. He was surprisingly patient though, more patient than a lot of the other travelers, also slept through the whole flight in the end! So anyway, worst trip ever on LOT's part. And then customer service couldn't even give me a different return flight (apart from one with a 16 hour layover instead of our original 2 hour) after a 24 hour delay. All this for $2,700 USD.

Fast forward to flight check in on April 29, 2023 and my seat assignments are not what I reserved. An hour and half later, and finally speaking to a Lufthansa rep and she cannot help me or refund my purchased seats. I am instructed to apply for a refund on-line after travel has been completed. It is now one week since I have returned from Athens and I have not been able to receive a refund. The on-line system won't recognize my booking code even though it shows ""verified"", and I receive error messages. I have made six calls to customer service with no service at all. I have been disconnected two times, and on other calls I am told that the ""system is down"", ""you have to do this on-line"", ""supervisors are unavailable to assist"", and ""due to the high call volume, I can't get you assistance"". The last call ended with the representative telling me to ""call back in 15 minutes"". I wish for this review to focus only on the customer service center.

Lufthansa,1,"""suitcase was no where to be found""","If you are ever promised to be reimbursed for expenses when they lose your luggage, don’t ever count on it.  My two kids and I flew to Germany several months ago. When we arrived in Berlin, my suitcase was no where to be found. I stood in line for over an hour. When I finally reached the front, I was told the bags were normally located within a day. They promised they would “do what they could” and that I would be reimbursed for any expenses that were incurred. The documents they handed me stated the same. The next day: no bag. I continued to check the website, call and email. No response. The website for lost luggage just stated it was still missing. We left and stopped at several second hand stores to find cheap clothes and other necessities, including a small suitcase and toiletries. I thought I did pretty well and kept the cost under $500.00. EXACTLY ONE WEEK LATER We were in Munich when I received an email notifying me the suitcase was in Berlin. The email had a phone number to call with any questions or concerns. No response to emails. Phone calls bounced through automated systems like a pinball. I selected every option throughout the entire system and never reached a live person. Two weeks later we arrived back in Berlin where we would stay for two more days before flying home. I went to the airport to finally retrieve the luggage. I parked in the temporary lot which allowed for 20 minutes of parking before fees incurred. I went in and, after much hunting, located the area where the lost bags office for Lufthansa. Literally hundreds and hundreds of suitcases, bags, etc. It took 40 minutes to find it. I mentioned paying the fine for the parking. The rep stated: “You can add it to the claim for reimbursement. Just keep the receipt”. We returned home and, within a couple weeks, I sent off the claim and receipts, along with copies of the original lost bag documents and emails I had received. After a month I received an email requesting I send the documents for the claim again. I resent the documents with the information. Six weeks later, I received another email requesting my ticket information and address. I sent the information back again with the message about a third time After two more months I received a final email: “Thank you for your feedback We sincerely apologize for the unintentional delay in responding to you. As Per your email, we regret to hear that your baggage was delayed at your destination. We can imagine what it meant for you to travel and not have your essential items as you intended.

Lufthansa,1,"""does not meet expectations""","I think the fact that Lufthansa states “We are aware that due to the steady increase in personal and business travel, we are currently unable to provide you with the excellent service you have come to expect from us” says it all. When customers book flights, they are entering an agreement (typically an expensive one) with the airline. In our case, we upheld our side of the bargain and Lufthansa consistently failed to uphold their end of the bargain. Never mind “unable to provide you with the excellent service you expect” - this was well below “does not meet expectations”. Our Journey from Hell - STEP 1: We originally were set to leave Dallas to Frankfurt for a connecting flight (both Lufthansa) to Toulouse. For reasons outside of our control/not related to weather, the plane was delayed. We chose to try to make our connecting flight instead of rebooking after speaking to the person at the front desk. We spent the entire 9 hour flight stressed about whether we’d make it in time. STEP 2: Our connecting flight was delayed - pretty on brand and a trend that would continue for the rest of our journey. At first we thought it was our lucky day, we sprinted across the entire first floor of Terminal A and up 5 flights of stairs to get to our terminal. WE MADE IT AS THEY WERE STILL BOARDING! We did everything in our control as the customer to be there, yet alas - as we presented our boarding passes, the attendant realized they had given away our seats to standby passengers that were standing right next to us. He pulled us aside, and as we were waiting for him to check our tickets, they continued to let other passengers board. We were finally told they only had 1 more seat left and moved us to the next flight which was a total of 6 hours later (plot-twist: you guessed it, that one was delayed by an 1.5 as I’m writing - AND COUNTING!) The icing on the cake is that they tried to give us $15 meal vouchers for our trouble, but upon presenting them to a vendor, they had not been loaded. DO WE EVER MAKE IT TO OUR DESTINATION? That is a question we still have no clue what the answer will be. We’re going on over 8 hours of total delays, the airports are closed tomorrow due to strikes. Also who knows where our bags are. I can only hope they uphold THEIR side of the agreement and get us to our destination. If you as an airline or business cannot uphold your end of the agreement, and continuously fail to meet the agreement, then it is my opinion that refunds should be provided.

We were then told that the seats that are in front of the bassinets are extra leg room and we need to purchase them in advance. We would have, if we had been told. Instead, I was stuck holding my son for 9 hours. While we were in Italy, we continuously called the airline to confirm our seats for the return flight. We were shuffled around by customer service, left on hold, then hung up on. Because we couldn't speak to anyone to have it taken care of, we went to the airport early to make sure we did not run into any problems again. We booked our bassinet and the extra leg room seats.

Norwegian,9,"""a great product for the price""","Have flown Norwegian over 30 times in the last year both short haul and long haul. This trip was a long haul from San Fran to Stockholm via London. I am a big fan of the airline. Almost always on time. Very friendly crew, especially in the long haul operation. Free wifi for all passengers regardless of ticket type (both short and long haul) and operates gate to gate (so no annoying need to log in and out on take off and landing). The premium offering long haul is, I would say, better than most airlines' premium economy but not as good as business class. Yet the price is exceptionally low for what you get. Essentially you pay about a normal airline's economy fare or less for an experience better than premium economy. The food in premium is high quality as are the drinks and the seats are good enough to get a reasonable sleep (although this is not a lie flat bed per business class). The IFE is modern and high quality albeit with a slightly smaller range of movies than a normal airline. Whilst Norwegian are no Ryanair, it is worth remembering that this is a budget airline. You are getting a major discount on long haul with a normal airline but in return you need to follow their rules. If your hand baggage weighs more than 10kg (or 15kg in premium) they will make you pay to check it in. In economy, you don't get a meal unless you pre-order and pay. Short haul they are more flexible with the rules on baggage but long haul they always check.

Then ushered into a bus and taken to the next terminal.  Our baggage was scanned again upon leaving the bus and then we found the gate – our hand luggage was scanned again and all our documents were checked once more where the worker was meticulously writing down (by hand) passport and ESTA numbers and taking photos with his phone of every single document! 3 days before our flight home, we received emails saying our LAX-Manila flight was going to be delayed significantly, meaning we would miss our connecting flight to Sydney.

Philippine Airlines,1,"""booking a flight is painful""","Over the last 10 years my husband and/or me have flown PAL roundtrip from LAX to Manila about 20 times. Flights are generally good, mostly on time, great crew, lousy food. However, their website and booking/refund policies are the worst. Almost every time we fly, their website has a problem with my credit card, then we have to spend at least an hour to call them, find the reservation, verify everything, then pay over the phone. This week I tried to book a flight, credit card rejected 4 times (Southwest Airlines VISA card with $35K credit limit that I charge everything to without issues), called, and by time we got through all the preliminary stuff the low rate I had online was gone. So we had to choose between changing my wife's family time by a day, or pay a higher fare. I have fought with customer service repeatedly over these issues to no avail. The last time this happened the customer service agent said this is a known problem and they are working on it. Really? For 9 years? I had to cancel a flight during COVID, waited 5 months for refund. Then they never fully refunded the extra charge for a good seat. BTW, now all of their aisle seats are a $20 surcharge. I have had cases where I tried to book the flight online, credit card rejected, I call, the first person finds the reservation and confirms everything, then I get transferred to another person who has to confirm everything again, then takes my credit card info and processes it, then transferred to a 3rd person who has to confirm everything again and does the seat assignments. On any other airline you can do this online in 10 minutes or less, no problem. Maybe the extra customer service expense is part of why they're in bankruptcy. Bottom line, flights are OK, booking a flight is painful, and the only reason we fly PAL is they are the only airline with direct flights from LA to Manila. If you plan to fly PAL, plan on the time the time you save by flying direct to be wasted on the phone.

Philippine Airlines,2,"""refunding the same ticket is 150 dollars""","The flight from LA to the final destination Dumaguete via Manila was actually relatively pain free. Seats are uncomfortable after a few hours especially when you are 6 foot plus like myself. Food was borderline comparable to just about any experience you've had in your life when you wish you didn't eat something but I believe just about all airlines serve bad meals.  My first major complaint with Philippine Airlines is the cost to check bags. The two bags I checked from LA to Manila were free. Checking the same two bags plus the two my wife had resulted in a 200 dollar fee for the relatively short flight from MNL to Dumaguete. That domestic flight wasn't even half full so not sure other than the obvious greediness explanation why Philippine Airlines charges this much to check bags. My other main complaint is I had also booked a one way ticket to Bangkok from Manila. As the date for that flight was getting close to arriving, my wife's mother became seriously ill and was hospitalized. This event made it impossible to make that flight to Bangkok. So I contacted Philippines Airline to request a refund since I don't know when my wife's mother will recover and we could visit Thailand as originally planned. A one way ticket from Manila was 130 dollars but Philippines Airline adds 50 dollars in fees just to book the ticket. The amount they charge for refunding the same ticket is 150 dollars. Not to mention the hoops you have to jump through with their request hub submission process and the ridiculous 25 to 30 minutes you have to spend on hold when they make you contact them by phone to explain the same exact details provided inside the written request. I'm not sure how these airlines are able to stay in business but one thing is very apparent, customer satisfaction isn't any type of priority or concern. It's a sad situation because the airlines in general and Philippines airline in particular seem to have way more interest in figuring out ways to gouge their customers every way possible than to follow practices that might make them happy.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,9/1/2022,Very Dissatisfied,Neutral,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Los Angeles,Manila,TRUE,Philippines,FALSE,International
PLAY,1,"""reduced our chances of boarding the flight""","I am writing this review to express my deep dissatisfaction and disappointment with the travel experience we encountered with Fly Play on flight OG102. I must acknowledge our own contribution to the problem as we were running just a little bit late for the flight and we fully understand and accept that responsibility. However, what followed left us perplexed and disheartened. Upon realizing that the flight was delayed by approximately 50 minutes, my husband and I, experienced travelers, considered this a fortunate turn of events. We proceeded to the check baggage counter, which was unmanned – understandable given our tardiness. We decided to get through TSA and inquire about gate checking our baggage at the gate. To our surprise, we encountered an extremely rude and unreasonable gate attendant. We politely requested if we could gate check our bag. Unfortunately, her response was an immediate refusal without providing any explanation. This was particularly disheartening as gate check had been a feasible option in the past, including with Play in September. Our attempts to seek clarification or speak to someone else were met with further hostility. The gate attendant claimed to be the sole authority and refused any further assistance, which left us feeling unheard and disrespected. The situation escalated when the gate attendant intentionally covered her name tag and displayed an offensive gesture towards us. We were unable to board the flight and learned from the chat bot that we were labeled as ""did not fly due to inappropriate behavior."" This statement is categorically false, and we were relieved when Play ultimately offered discounted tickets as compensation after hours of pleading via chat and trying to come to some resolution. Nonetheless, we firmly believe that the entire situation could and should have been handled more professionally and with greater courtesy by your employee, who represents your company's values and image. While we understand that being late reduced our chances of boarding the flight, we firmly believe that every passenger deserves to be treated with respect and kindness. We would have gladly accepted any reasonable explanation for not being able to gate check our bag. Instead, the encounter left us with a sense of shock and disappointment that overshadowed the entire travel experience. We sincerely hope that this matter will be taken seriously and addressed appropriately to prevent similar incidents in the future. As loyal customers, we believe in the value of constructive feedback, and we trust that Fly Play will endeavor to ensure a more positive and respectful experience for all passengers.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,7/1/2023,Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Neutral,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Baltimore,Keflavik,TRUE,Iceland,FALSE,International

PLAY,2,"""most miserable experience of my life""","Flying with Play was the most miserable experience of my life. The booking was easy, as was the check in. There were no delays and everything went smoothly. There is a massive issue however with the fact that they don't have a phone number. Never deal with a company that can't be contacted by phone. If anything goes wrong, you're on your own. While everything outside the craft was fine, inside the plane is a different story altogether. Firstly, getting seated was an absolute farce. The lack of organisation by the cabin crew seemed to rub off on the passengers. Several people switched seats, meaning some found another person sat in their seat. I've never seen this before on such a scale and I can therefore only attribute it to the fact that the cabin crew were not checking boarding passes or directing anyone. Getting seated took longer than I've ever seen on an aircraft and at no time were the crew trying to speed things along. The plane started taxiing with passengers still stood up. The main issue with the flight was the seats. I have never seen this many rows on this type of aircraft. There is no way on earth these things should be in the air for more than an hour. I am 5ft6 and I had so little leg room that I could not physically reach down to pull my bag up. If you are 6ft+ you realistically cannot fly this airline.  As if this could not be any worse, the seats recline. Yes. They recline. The room in front of me was reduced to level where I could not put my tray table down. It was 6 hours of absolute torture. Some passengers spent the entire flight stood in the aisle as they could not sit for that long. Everything on this flight is paid for separately. Fine. It's a budget airline. I get it. But water? Surely this is a basic human necessity. It was 3 Euros for the smallest bottle of water I've ever seen in my life. Please do not make the same mistake I did. Not only is it torture but it makes no financial sense. After adding in the extra legroom seat costs (you will need it), water and food, you are likely to be saving little to nothing. Take a real airline. You'll thank me. I'm sure Play will reply with their ""hi thanks we're a budget airline as such"" spiel, but it's not good enough. These planes should not exist.

PLAY,3,"""Terrible experience""","Terrible experience. I’ll never fly with PLAY again. Our return flight on 11 February 2023 from Paris to Baltimore was to have a brief layover in Keflavik, but weather caused a delay. The delay then became a cancellation, which then became a delay again. Our departure went from 1130 to 2230 on Saturday 11 February 2023 as a result. After navigating the options provided to us we decided to accept the delayed departure, but because of the earlier cancellation, we had already booked with PLAY to depart on Sunday 12 February 2023 at 1130. We cancelled our taxi, had begun looking for a hotel near the airport, made arrangements for the care of our minor child who was at home in America, contacted our employers of the change and requested extra time off from work. All of this was for naught when the flight was merely delayed 11 hours. This required us to check out of our hotel, arrange for our luggage to be secured by them, schedule another taxi and spend extra time and money in Paris until the 2230 departure. At no point was an updated itinerary sent with the new time, nor were we sent an electronic boarding pass. Upon checking into CDG airport in Paris we were given our boarding passes to Keflavik, but no information regarding our next flight from Keflavik to Baltimore. No boarding pass, no explanation or departure time, no information from any employee at the PLAY terminal or from the flight crew while in flight or on the ground. We weren’t advised of where to go or what to do next. After landing in Keflavik at approximately 0300, we determined through a search that there is only one flight daily from Keflavik to BWI and the departure time was 1515 hours; an unplanned layover of approximately 12 hours. With no hotel availability, my wife and I spent 12 hours trying to sleep on hard wooden benches with all of our luggage piled around us. After showering, dressing and departing our hotel on Saturday we would now be faced with wearing the same clothes and no chance to shower till we arrived home over 36 hours later. We could not check into our flight from Keflavik to BWI until 1215; so we stayed close to the terminal that airport employees told us would be opened by PLAY personnel eventually. Passengers filled a “roped” off section near the kiosks where the PLAY check-in would take place. An employee told everyone inside the “roped” off area that they would need to move to a different “roped” off section which chicaned to 4-5 PLAY check-in counters. Passengers asked why they couldn’t just stay in the line and go to the counters. Her response was, This is not the line. The line is here, so you’ll have to go to the other line (not quoting, but words to that affect). This caused people to start ducking under the “ropes”, dashing around cordoned off areas into the other area or those of us who were outside to make our way into the designated area. There was no thought or consideration given to those who had been standing patiently waiting for the customer service counters to be opened. The bond female, then left and there we only two booking agents to deal with the throng of passengers waiting to check in.

Not one unpleasant self-centred passengers on my trips. The airline is based in Iceland and the PLAY planes are red. Bright red all over. $404 dollars for a roundtrip ticket to Spain. For that kind of cost I have no problem bringing my own sandwiches and soft drinks into the plane.

I assumed I could add my infant at in-person check-in but it took a whole hour and we had to pay fees equivalent to 1/3 of our adult ticket price. When sent the payment link, it was asking me to log in and didn’t have an option to create an account. It finally worked when I used a different internet browser - only to find when I got home that we were charged twice! We made our flight just in time (only because they boarded late and the ticketing agent escorted us through security) but our checked bag never made it to our destination. Upon arrival, we and 2 other families from our flight were missing bags and there was no one at the London Stansted airport to help us. Another airline’s agent tried and directed us to the online lost baggage form, which was not accepting any of our flight numbers. Finally, mine worked but the other 2 families had to fill out a paper form. A few days after arrival I received a text that my bag was found and being sent to the airport - and that status remained unchanged until I got to the airport to go home a week later. I got useless responses from a WhatsApp bot and never heard back on the email I sent, until after I had returned from my trip. My brand new bag (now damaged) had been at the arrival airport for a few days but the online status system was never updated to reflect that and I never received the email that the manager said she sent me. And the bag was certainly not delivered to my local address as the form said it would. Even after we collected the bag for the return flight, the status of the lost bag (on route but not yet delivered to the airport) was unchanged. For a week my toddler and I went without any of our clothes and without his medicines. It was incredibly frustrating to not have any real person to speak with. I don’t know how an airline can operate without staff in their airports and rely on robot communication and websites that don’t work. This airline has not invested the human and technology resources they need to support their customers. The in-flight experience also sucks. I don’t expect the world from a budget airline but £3 for a tiny bottle of water and row screens that only show the flight status (that I could never interpret) was a huge bummer.

And that's exactly what happened on the second day. Anyway, when his flight was rebooked the second time, he was in Toronto (after arriving from Newark) and for some reason the person who booked this flight selected the departing location as Newark again, so when he arrived at the airport for his flight they couldn't locate him (because he was in Toronto, not Newark) and they said they couldn't do anything for him.

It's been nearly 1 year while I wait for ticket to be refunded, 1 year. Just a moment ago, I got off the phone during my once a week call to the Royal Air Maroc customer service, asking if perhaps this is the week they will do the right thing and give me my money back. Sadly, no this isn't the week. The nice lady on the phone informed me it's only been 3 months since receiving my refund claim and that due to covid, things can take a bit longer. Well, let's start with the fact that the airline never notified me of the flight cancellation, and made zero effort to communicate with me regarding the cancellation, or credit or a refund for 6 months after they cancelled the flight. Once I finally reached out via phone call and email, I waited another several months with no reply. At this point, obviously frustrated, I began calling back more frequently and was finally notified that my refund claim was filed incorrectly and I had to file it again. So now nearly 1 year later, while chatting with this nice lady on the phone, she tells me that since I've only waited 3 months since my claim was re-filed, I simply haven't waited long enough. How long is long enough? At this point, it's pretty clear that I was essentially robbed by this airline, and the most frustrating part is that every time I call asking when they will do the right thing, they just smile and keep lying more. Beyond awful service, companies like this should be pursued criminally. While I don't wish anyone to go through such experiences, one look at Royal Air Maroc online reviews and the story becomes clear. I'm not the first and won't be the last. But hopefully, through reviews such as this and those of others who've been cheated, people will eventually avoid, avoid, avoid, until Royal Air Maroc does right by its customers, or goes out of business.

On 12 August, we were on a flight that was less than half full, on a large A321 with plenty of overhead and cabin space. I assume because they wanted to make some extra bang for their buck, they stopped every single person at the boarding pass counter and made them weigh every carry on. If you wanted to keep it, you had to pay $100 to check it, whether it had medications or anything. The average weight of just a carry on bag alone is 9 lbs, meaning virtually no carry on will ever be light enough to be under 17 lbs.

(No phone number was provided and when we asked the employee behind the counter she repeatedly told us to email customer service. The flight was not rescheduled until January 19, 2018, two full days later. This left us holding the bag for a hotel and rental car on Faial which had been pre-paid and we missed out on. We also had taxis, food, etc. in Boston while we were waiting to find out if our flight was going to be rescheduled. (Not to mention that the Azores in January is 50-60 degrees, while Boston was around 30 degrees! We were not packed appropriately at all and had to purchase additional clothing to compensate for the differing climates.) Since that time, I have sent numerous emails and Facebook messages to SATA. Their response, after months of emails to the customer care email are two-fold. One: “The contract that is made with the Airline Company, only contemplates the passengers transportation until the final destination. The reasons for which someone travels from one point to the other are unknown to the airline company, therefore, we can neither be held responsible when a passenger fails to show at a scheduled location, nor when other contracts are made with other entities.”  Our flights were booked through a travel agent but they are all with SATA. So SATA does know we were flying on to Faial; we were on their flight. And, moreover, they re-booked us through to Faial two days after our originally scheduled departure. Two, after months of asking for reimbursement: “If you have any expenses regarding any meals you had to make during that waiting, please send them together with your bank details information (account holder, name of bank, address of bank, account number, bic/swift code, routing) for their analysis and eventual reimbursement according to SATAs regulation.” Of course I have had no acknowledgement that they even received my email, or follow-up emails. To top things off, when they did rebook us, the airplane was decrepit. The heating/cooling system didn’t work. The seats were the smallest, most uncomfortable things ever. And the flight attendants were rude. My family and I had flown SATA in the past and had no issues. However, after this total lack of, and disregard for, customer service, I will most likely be flying TAP Portugal. I understand things happen.

Upon my arrival in Newark, I could not find my bag so I thought they maybe I would get in when I arrived in Boston. To my dismay I got to Boston and could not find my bag anywhere! I contacted SATA, TAP, JetBlue to no avail! I got an email from TAP and JetBlue, apologizing for the incident and informing me that they would try to locate my bag.

The folks in the US basically told me to get lost because it was not their problem even though I have been flying SATA for almost 20 years! My brother in Lisbon spent hours at the airport, trying to locate the bag, since, in accordance with safety rules a bag cannot fly without the passenger so we were hoping that the bag was lying somewhere in Lost & Found in Lisbon.

SATA Air Azores,5,"""I have no real complaints""","Boston to Ponta Delgada return. I've seen a lot of negative reviews about Azores Airlines/SATA. I recently completed four segments with them and found that most of the complaints were not well-founded. To preface this, the reader should remember that Azores Airlines is a budget carrier. The Azores are a small region of Portugal that has been historically underdeveloped. If you keep these concepts in mind and adjust your expectations accordingly, you can have a positive experience like the one I had. I flew two segments on one of Azores' old A310s (BOS-PDL and return). There aren't many of these around anymore, and I was interested to see how it had held up over the 25 years of service. The planes seemed to be in good condition, with a couple of cosmetic exceptions. Legroom was not great, the flights were less than 5 hours. On one, we upgraded to exit row seating (20A/B) and had unlimited leg room. It was well worth the $65 PP cost. The other two segments (PDL-BCN and return) were on newer A320s.

SATA Air Azores,1,"""avoid this airline at all costs""","I booked and paid for 5 adult flights from Boston to Ponta Delgado, Sao Miguel in the Azores for a birthday trip destined to leave Boston Logan at Saturday 9:15pm. We were told the flight was delayed ""for technical reasons"" until 2am Sunday morning. After waiting 5 hours, Azores reps told us the flight was canceled; they had no more information and ""to check back tomorrow"". They offered a phone number to call, but the office is closed until Monday morning. At this point, the crowd became very agitated and we noticed that they had called the Boston State Police to control the crowd. Two passengers got into a fight over waiting in line. We were told that this happens on a regular basis & the State police were called out the previous Saturday. After calling around, we discovered that every hotel in Boston was booked for this Saturday night. Most people wound up sleeping on cots in the terminal. We finally found a Best Western 30 miles outside of town, arriving at 5am. The most frustrating part was that the airline representatives would not provide anyone any information at all. We returned to the airport the following afternoon and were told that we would be on the 9:30 flight, ""IF... they had enough crew show up"". Two other outgoing flights were delayed, another fight broke out and the State police showed up again! We finally departed at 2am on Monday morning. During our 2-day delay, we heard from several of the Boston Logan airport staff that SATA airlines does this on a routine basis. The desk agents promised I would be reimbursed for our hotel and taxi fare, but after two weeks of emailing them, I have yet to hear from them.

I was also disappointed in the customer service I received when I reported the lost baggage. The staff was unhelpful and unsympathetic, and it was clear that they did not take my complaint seriously.

They kept giving us the run around - telling us to contact their WhatsApp support line (more on this), or to email them. Finally, after no success on those fronts, they were able to cancel the flights on our 5th or 6th phone attempt. They claim the customer service phone department - where you can talk to humans - is completely disconnected from refunds processing - and you can only do the latter via WhatsApp or email. The WhatsApp support is the laziest, most lackadaisical responsiveness I've ever seen. They claim 24/7 support but regularly take 6-10 hours to respond to a chat and start a conversation. When they do reply (usually with 1 word or 1 line), if you don't reply within 10 minutes they close the chat out and you have to start the conversation all over again with another agent. - I repeated this cycle for 4 days on repeat just to be able to submit a simple refund request for a flight they cancelled. Phone support was unwilling to process a refund. Once I did eventually get through a submit a refund claim via WhatsApp, the phone agent was unable and unwilling to give me any indication of refund status.

Silver Airways,1,"""worst experience I’ve ever had""","I booked a non-stop round trip ticket to Pensacola from Tampa through United Airlines, only to be shuffled off onto Silver Airways, a company I’d never even heard of. The first problem occurred before my actual travel date, when I received an email informing me that my return flight time had been changed to two hours earlier, which meant I would be getting up at 5am to make the return flight. The REAL problem began when I arrived at the airport in Tampa to find that my departure flight had been delayed for at least 4 hours. I received no prior texts or email regarding the delay, and was forced to spend the next 6 hours at the airport, again with no updates except those on the terminal screens, as Silver Airways has no app, and there was no representative at the gate. The person I dealt with at the Silver Airway ticket counter was one of the rudest individuals I’ve ever met - bored, annoyed, and with no people skills whatsoever, sighing heavily when I asked for possible flight alternatives, with more concern for her 4 inch fingernails getting chipped by the computer keyboard than for a paying customer like me. When she told me there were no other flights that day, I asked about changing my return flight to a later time so I could spend more time at my destination, at which point she told me that I wasn’t even booked for a return flight. When I produced my printed confirmation email, she just said, “Well, I don’t know what to tell you.” When I asked if I could speak with someone else, she picked up the phone and called someone else, who evidently told her that the only return flight was already fully booked and I could make no changes. She then hung up before I could speak to that person myself. I went to the United ticket counter (since I’d originally booked with them) to see if they could help me, only to be told that I had to deal with Silver, as all in-state flights had been subcontracted to them. Stuck at the airport for the next 6 hours, I waited for the delayed aircraft to arrive with no more updates other than the terminal screens, only to discover that the aircraft was a small turboprop, which I would never have agreed to had I only known. Finally boarded the plane 4 and a half hours later than scheduled, having to drag my luggage across the tarmac and up a very steep, very narrow set of stairs - not an easy task for a 64 year old woman - with no offers of assistance from the ground crew standing by and watching me struggle. I travel frequently, all over the world, and this was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had - poor communication, unexplained flight changes, no flight app, and rude treatment at the ticket counter.

And then they finally said they were gonna change my flight for the the next day. This also happened to the other 23 people that were going on the plane behind me but I was the first one to arrive at the counter. They moved me aside and told me they were gonna put us all on the plane. They started to put everyone on the plane besides me and then they told me I wouldn’t be able to get on the plane. I was the only one that wasn’t able to fly that night on the plane. This is the worst airline in the US I have tried and would not recommend this to anyone. A review doesn’t describe how terrible my experience was or how bad this airline is.

Silver Airways,1,"""worst airline I have ever seen""","Silver Airways is without a doubt the worst airline I have ever seen in my life. I had a 10 PM flight from Jacksonville to Fort Lauderdale, a few hours before the flight I got a notice that the departure was pushed back until 11:15 another hour later I got an email stating it was taking off at 12:10. Finally I arrive at the airport at 10:45 to make sure I make my 12:10 departure time upon arrival at the airport they delayed it to 1:10 am. Once I arrived at the gate I waited there until which the worker at the desk stated to all of the passengers that the crew had timed out and they will be delaying the flight until 10 am the following morning. Many passengers were frustrated including one women who told the assistant at the desk that she had driven 3 hours and doesn’t have money for a hotel and hopes they can put her up for the night in a hotel. The same worker told the lady “There’s nothing I can do for you because it’s not our fault so it’s not my problem, you can sleep in the airport”. I was completely in awe of the absolute disrespect silver and their airline employees showed to passengers who payed a lot of money to get to their destinations on time safely. The following morning I arrived at the airport at 8:30 to make sure I will make my 10 am flight. I then was told that the flight was delayed until 12:30 pm. So after waiting 4 hours until 12 PM all of the passengers were seated at the gate and waiting anxiously. 30 minutes from our expected take off there were still no crew members at the gate, no pilots and the plane was parked on the other side of the tarmac. The pilots finally arrived but still no crew members at the gate. We continued to wait with absolutely no update of any kind and we’re further delayed passed our expected departure. After numerous attempts to contact silver airlines there was no response and it said there was nobody available at the call center and to try again later. I had tried 6 times to get in contact with no answer. We finally boarded our flight an hour later and the desk agents were rude and showed extreme levels of ignorance towards passengers who were trying to display their dissatisfaction with the entire process. Safe to say I will never ever fly silver airways again even if it is my only option.

I understand planes have mechanical problems and i definitely do not want to fly on a plane that’ does. I don’t understand why they told us they were going to switch to the other plane then cancel. It was ridiculous the lack of communication. On top of all that they gave us $12 food vouchers.

I asked why the wrong gate is still displayed. They have no control over the boards. I asked can't you call whoever is in control of the departure and gate displays? No answer.

First thing, flight got delayed and delayed and delayed so we ended up with an email saying 7:12 pm flight out and then their website saying 6:11 pm the former delay prior to this.

The people all in front of us were angry because of the lack of service and common sense the Silver Airways staff showed. The lack of simple “I’m sorry that your flight is cancelled, but here’s what you can do” didn’t exist and when it was our turn and we had just missed the flight, this is about 7:15 pm now, we walk up and speak to the agent who has no idea what to do and says that. Literally says to us “I don’t know what to do and what you want me to do” excuse me? So after asking her what can we do? How do we re-route? She informs us in a nasty tone and attitude that they don’t do that. They didn’t help. They didn’t do a thing and refused to help.

Then I asked flight attendant, would they arrange hotel accommodations for everybody since we had to turn around? She said they would take care of the hotel combinations and then get everybody back on the plane, for the next day. As we arrived in Tampa pilot got back on the intercom, and made the announcement that the plane would leave you in Tampa, then head back to Fort Lauderdale. I asked the pilot and another flight attendant about the hotel accommodations, and they said that, they will not be responsible for hotel accommodations or to arrange for the return home flight.

Silver Airways,1,"""questioned my lack of a negative Covid test""","We were scheduled to fly Ft Lauderdale FL to Eleuthera, Bahamas. Upon arrival at the airport, we presented the ticket agent with our travel documents. My husband had his passport, Bahamas Travel Visa and a negative Covid test. I had my passport, Bahamas Travel Visa, a letter from my physician, and an exemption letter from the ministry of travel of the Bahamas granting me an exemption to the testing requirement as I had recently recovered from Covid. One ticket agent questioned my lack of a negative Covid test and another agent ended up stamping us approved after some discussion. We cleared security and proceeded to the concourse where we had lunch and checked with the gate a few times to make sure flight was on time etc. As we approached the gate 45 minutes from departure, we were being paged. At that time, we were told that the airline's safety officer was denying us travel because I did not have a negative test to produce. We had to go back to the ticket counter, where one of there agents saw us approaching and recommended we check with Bahamas Air. Bahamas Air sold us a ticket which got us to Nassau where we had to overnight and then connect to Eleuthera the following day. This new ticket cost us over $700, plus over $300 to overnight in Nassau and the loss of a night at our rental in Eleuthera at $1000.00 per night. Silver Airways flies passengers on domestic routes all day with no Covid test so this decision was clearly not based in any logic or safety. The reason you no longer test until negative is some people test positive for up to 3 months. I never had one symptom but continue to test positive.

Silver Airways,1,"""travel plans are ruined thanks to them""","I have not actually flown on Silver Airways. My family were scheduled to fly last April which of course was the beginning of the real shut downs on travel. Obviously, things were going on that following up on the ticket was not top of mind. In November, I had enough bandwidth to go back to revisit. At first I was told it had been refunded and was sent a receipt with the date of refund and the CC# that I had paid it on. After some research, I found it had not been refunded. I then emailed guest relations as another avenue since I was not getting anywhere with the initial rep and asked what was going on. I was told via email that the money had actually been put in a travel bank with a user ID to login and check. After multiple attempts at requesting a password, to no avail, I called back to find out what was going on since the date I was hoping to travel was fast approaching. The rep on the phone discovered that the User ID I had been provided was in fact not me. Days pass and I'm given a new User ID and successfully manage to log into the travel bank only to see that there was nothing in it. I ask what the status is once again through email and am told it should be resolved in the next few days. Three days after the date I was told it would be resolved by, there is still nothing in my travel bank and the prices keep going up beyond the value of my former ticket, which, if they had done this correctly in the first place, would have been covered by my balance. Now, it is looking like I have to cancel the trip again because of their incompetence. I don't have my money and I don't have a flight. It's appalling. I'm actually trying to book another ticket with them (lawd knows why) but I can't even do that. And sadly, they are the only player to the destination.

Southwest Airlines,2,"""why would I ever fly with them again""","The day started with a notice while we were departing our cruise ship notifying us of a delay on our flight from Houston to San Diego. We noticed the change reduced our layover to 40 minutes, so we headed directly to the airport to give us time to resolve the conflict. We arrived 6 hours before our scheduled time, so I stood in line for over an hour to discuss the issue with the over-worked agent who told me that my best bet was to keep the schedule as she didn't see anything that was better. This phrase came up a lot, but their agents are clearly trained to tell clients that they don't have control of the weather, etc. regarding delays. The only flights from Southwest that were delayed were those to San Diego (it was not weather related as the flights to and from San Diego were also on schedule except ours). After waiting until we could check luggage (4.5hrs), we went through security to our gate only to see the delay had been extended (5 minute layover). Agent 2 told me that she could only find another flight with 1 seat headed to Boise, but she could only see Houston connections, so I called their 800 number. 3rd agent was an explanation followed by hold/hang-up. 4th agent was actually willing to change the flights to another option, but because we checked baggage #4 (the only person willing to help us) had to send me back to the terminal agents with the flight information. 5th agent is unwilling to change the flight because the plane from San Diego to Boise has 17 passengers and is going to wait for us. I asked if we could be boarded in front or so we could make our connection, but that would be unfair to everyone else, so we sat in the back. I knew I was being lied to, but at this point I figured I'd just wait to see what would happen. We fly to San Diego to find a nice message once we were off airplane mode about how our flight left and we were given new boarding passes for a later flight along with a $100 voucher for a later flight (YAY!). I looked at my pass and it was an ""A"" position which was nice and handed off the other 3 for our family to my wife and went in search of food (terminal was super crowded due to construction) so we grabbed some snacks and found a spot on the floor to sit. I mentioned how it was nice that we didn't get boarded last and my son tells me his pass was C-30 and his girlfriend was C-15. I took our passes to the 7th agent (6 was for new passes) and expressed that it was ridiculous that my family was not set to board together. She immediately went off about how unfair it was for other passengers. I stated that my original tickets were in the A group for that leg of the flight (in an irritated voice), but she stuck to her argument. At this point, I was done with their service, so I expressed to her that I had spent the better part of 12 hours trying to get them to correct the issue and completely ignored. She threatened me regarding getting on the plane and finally got me a supervisor. The supervisor #8 and I had a long discussion regarding the situation and continued down the road of unfairness, but she would allow us to board together. She mentioned the $100 vouchers, but why would I ever fly with them again - I'd pay not to (and told her so). She also asked why I didn't ask for a supervisor - Isn't that their job when they can't help a customer? Flying with Southwest is just not worth the trouble.

Some backstory - I just graduated college and am supporting my fiancé as he finishes college. After doing year-round school, I have about $2,000 to my name in addition to student debt I still owe. Since we are paying for our own honeymoon, we wanted something very affordable. We were planning on just going somewhere local when my fiancé's parents shared a 48 hour deal for Southwest tickets to go to Hawaii. They offered roundtrip tickets to 4 islands for under $350. We were ecstatic! Since my fiancé was saving for a ring I was in charge of purchasing the flights. I hurried to purchase them but then we found out housing was pretty expensive so we switched out flight to another island on the deal. Little did I know switching made the deal invalid. This wasn't mentioned in the email. I did notice it cost extra but thought the deal was still on there so the total couldn't be too much (this was my first time scheduling a flight and I was under time pressure so I was a bit naïve). After paying the difference, I looked a the confirmation email and saw that the total was $1250! I was working so I rushed to an office and got a hold of customer service and they told me that piece of information about changing flight locations. Apparently a lot of people were experiencing the same issue. I started crying explaining that I had no idea the deal wasn't applied and if there was any way I could get my money back. They said that if I canceled I could only get flight credit. I hung up and called my fiancé right away. I was bawling my eyes out explaining how I had messed up our honeymoon and we could never afford the trip at full cost. After that phone call I had to go back to work like everything was okay.

This time when I arrived at the airport in Philadelphia to return home (this was a round trip booking) I checked in at the counter and reminded them that I had signed up for a wheelchair.

I asked her if she could take me to my gate as the plane was about to board and she said she ""worked for ...... airline and couldn't take southwest passengers"". Then she said that If I could walk to the nearby elevator she could take me. She told me not to get into the wheelchair until the elevator door closed and then she took me to the gate.

I and several members of my company have been flying Southwest for the past several years because the service and convenience had been exemplary particularly when taking into account the reasonable pricing.

After filing a lost report soon after deplaning, I received no helpful assistance from the airline other than an email three days later stating that they were looking into it and should consider the case close if no further notice had been received withing 30 days. Misplacing a phone these days does not only cause a significant financial impact but the information contained may be critical. For this reason, a more definitive answer than the nonchalant response from Southwest baggage supervisor at Midway Airport stating that they would be drowned in lost items that they receive daily then added 40-50 things including I-Pads, phones, and other items. This statement struck me as particularly irritating since the two individuals at the office were sitting without no apparent task at the time. With the concern that she displayed, I must conclude that the case is probably lost and that the decision to purchase another phone (regardless of cost) should be undertaken. I would have hoped that they might ask me to text my phone to more quickly identify the fact that they may or may not have it in their procession now at the Alabama location where all the lost items from all the Southwest flights go (now many thousands of items per day instead of 40-50).

Southwest Airlines,1,"""nothing short of a disappointment""","I recently had the misfortune of flying with Southwest Airlines, and I must say that my experience was nothing short of a disappointment. From the moment I stepped foot onto their plane, it was evident that this airline lacks the professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction that one would expect. First and foremost, Southwest Airlines had no regard for punctuality. My flight was delayed once, and then they decided to rebook it for an unreasonably early hour in the morning. This unexpected change disrupted my entire travel plans and left me feeling exhausted before I even boarded the aircraft. It is unacceptable for an airline to make such drastic alterations without a valid reason or proper compensation. To make matters worse, Southwest's servers seemed to be in a state of disarray. Throughout the booking process, I encountered multiple technical glitches and slow response times on their website. It was frustrating to witness a company of this scale failing to maintain their online infrastructure, leading to additional stress and wasted time on my end. The flight itself was another disappointing aspect of my experience. The plane's condition was subpar. Southwest Airlines made a promise to compensate me for the inconvenience caused by their multiple delays and rebooking. They specifically mentioned a $200 voucher, which I was eagerly looking forward to. However, even after reaching out to their customer service department, I was met with indifference and received no resolution. It is disheartening to be on the receiving end of such false promises, especially when they have a direct impact on the customer experience. In conclusion, my experience with Southwest Airlines was marred by their unprofessionalism, lack of punctuality, technical glitches, and broken promises.

Southwest Airlines,3,"""again denied this ""freebie"" service""","In 2007 Southwest served: 64.9 million cans of soda, juices, and water 11.3 million alcoholic beverages 6.1 million bags of pretzels 103.8 million bags of peanuts 14 million snackpacks 32 million other snacks Just think how much money Southwest would save if they stopped offering all those ""free"" drinks but then the public would go crazy.  Our beverage service has been canceled on probably 8 out of the last 10 flights I have been on.  And no I don't fly the same place so its not likely due to a specific route. But - if you do the math - Southwest is lost a TON of money due to the Christmas Flight debacle last year.  An average soda costs about $0.75 - $1.00 for the airlines, once you factor in the cost of the drink itself (they purchase cans), the cup, and the ice (which isnt much).  On average a flight has about 150 passengers - that's easily $112 - $150 they can put in their pocket when they ""cancel"" beverage service - and that's assuming each passenger only has one drink. On a recent flight (the one I'm on as I write this) - we were once again denied this ""freebie"" service in the name of supposed ""turbulence"" despite a relatively smooth flight.  I've heard others mention that the captain is the one who makes that decision, so I asked. When I asked about this, instead of simply answering my question, letting me know that the captain made the decision, etc. the flight attendant said something like ""let me find out"".   A few minutes later, the captain came on and ""explained"" why he felt it was important to cancel service - essentially providing an excuse for why they did this.  When I asked for the captain's name, so i could verify this with SWA customer service, I was met with another flight attendant who basically told me ""were not going to do that"" and refused to give me his name. He also threatened that they would ""divert the plane""  although I was extremely calm and was seated in my seat, not yelling or anything.  I guess I was talking loud enough for other passengers to hear - can't have more than one passenger figure out the little secret. Although I dont know what they are so worried about.  Most of the passengers on the plane will never even tell their friend or a significant other about the experience, let alone do anything that could actually make a difference (like report this on social media or via customer service). But still you dont have to ""hide"" and refuse to provide your name if you aren't doing anything wrong.  So this is all being done in the name of ""safety"" - lets go with that.",Business,Economy Class,5/1/2023,Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Satisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Denver,Salt Lake City,TRUE,United States,TRUE,Domestic

Because of the droves of people around the woman calling out boarding information, I could not hear her. She used a tiny microphone which actually none of us could hear. She then chose to yell out information which no one could hear either. Being my first time flying SW, I unfortunately, hadn’t researched how they board people. I had no idea where “C” was and asked around to finally find where my boarding area was. There was a fellow “C” woman who moved around, so I followed her. She said that since “A loaded, C could now line up.” It was then I figured out what the other number was on my ticket- so I lined up in that spot that was on a sign. As I got on the plane, I asked the flight attendant how I get a seat, “you just chose anything open.” I had no idea. And I had checked my boarding pass and even “pre-boarded.” How did I miss this information? It truly was a cattle call boarding experience.

Yet there were 20 pre boarders on the first leg and 18 on the second leg - many who walked into the plane (only 5 wheel chairs total) The boarding process has become a joke as pre boarders, sit in the front 3-5 rows. So I think I'm going to request that every time I fly now because I pay $100 or so extra to get first choice of seat and overheard, yet that is no longer available because ALL pre borders have forced those who pay extra to sit in what's left.

Flight changes for our international flight now cost 5K and southwest says they are not responsible for flight delays and inability to get me to my destinations on time! I have never had such a negative overall experience during my travels that I had to take a moment just to air out the grievance at 4AM while still traveling.  A short hour flight became a 3-hour overall flight due to inclement weather and being re-routed to Grand Rapids Michigan.

Adjustments were made to get me flown to Seattle after waiting all night to get my bags in order to re-check them I was treated extremely poorly by the check-in bag personnel who was training another employee. She was very curt, abrasive, dry, and mean. When I brought it to her attention that I had been stuck awake in the airport all night and that I did not appreciate her demeanor she brushed it off and continued in a very aggressive energy to nitpick anything i said or did, such as placing both bags on the scale after the first one had been weighed.

Southwest Airlines,1,"""This is just awful""","I had a horrible trip. I booked a trip from Oakland Ca. to Savannah Ga. in Nov. 2022. I HATE flying early, so I booked a flight that had a reasonable, late-morning departure and paid the extra money for a better schedule. About a week before my trip in April of 2023, Southwest canceled my flights and rebooked my whole trip. So, I had to get up at 3.30am to be at the airport by 4.30am for my new take-off time of 5.55am. Exactly what I didn't want and paid extra to avoid. There was no refund for my extra payment when they forced me onto the early undesirable schedule. Then.... On my return home from Savannah, our plane was delayed taking off at the Savannah airport. It turns out the fuel truck for our plane didn't have enough fuel in it. Seriously. So they went and got more fuel and then refuelled our plane which caused a delay to our connection in Houston. We would have had 9 minutes (given the delay for fuelling) to catch our flight in Houston, but Southwest elected to keep the plane to Oakland on time and leave us behind. Great. Now we are rebooked through Southwest for a flight the next day and we are in Houston overnight. And guess what? I have to get on a plane at 6.15am which is exactly why I paid extra money for my original schedule to avoid. The representative at the Houston airport was really nice (Angie G.) and we got a hotel voucher and a $200 Southwest voucher. But this just isn't enough. I'm arriving 16 hours late. I'm staying in a city overnight that I don't care to be in, and cutting my sleep for the second time in a week to keep a flight schedule that I didn't authorize or sign up for. I paid my pet sitter $200 to stay the night in my home and take care of my pets unexpectedly for the extra night. Where is the actual compensation for the 16 hours of my life that I spent overnight in Houston? I had to eat. I had to pay my pet sitter. I lost sleep and essentially, I lost an entire day of rest at home before my work week. This is just awful. I don't know what is going on with this airline, but I have no interest in your voucher to plan a trip with you ever.

I found a wheelchair and walked pushing the wheelchair towards my connecting gate which was at the farthest end of the airport last gate.

Southwest Airlines,2,"""attendant was extremely rude""","I’m pretty sure that Southwest can not afford to continue to lose passengers. I traveled with a 10 week old puppy. I paid the fee $95. Which I was ok with until they said I had to check my bag because she counts as my carry on. If she counts as my carry on why is there a fee. She’s not taking up any extra space. She weighs less than a normal carry on as well. I was told she had to be under the seat for take off and landing but on the plane the flight attendant was extremely rude. She told me she had to go back in her pet carrier. I explained what I was told and she continued to be extremely rude. I proceeded to put her back in her carrier under the seat, where she remained. The flight attendant came back to ask me my last name and then asked if I ‘she was even a paid pet’. I proceeded to show her my receipt and the tag on the carrier. Stated if she was that concerned she should have checked when I boarded and not half way through the flight. I had my jacket on my lap and every time she passed by made me lift my jacket to show she wasn’t on my lap. Which she never was - she remained in the carrier for the remainder of the flight. They have lost another customer due to very rude employees. If the rule is they have to stay in the carrier for the duration of the flight that should be clearly communicated when checking in. Also there is always a polite way to deal with customers but the employees continue to be unnecessarily rude. I will make sure to tell everyone that travels with pets my experience from now on.

I rebooted my flight and requested assistance which was not given after I specifically told them I couldn't lift per Dr. Orders but didn't get help until second time where I had to go through security again andI had to pay fora carry on bag. I was told I would get a flight credit due to SW canceling my trip because they sent my mom one. When I called to ask about it again they told me I don't get one after I had been waiting for the email I was promised. I am beyond disgusted as a customer and if the situation is not handled I will not be using SW again and will make sure to tell everyone I know not to use them either. They are a dishonest company who doesn't care about their customers or taking care of them as promised. I understand mistakes happen but what happened to me is not acceptable and won't be tolerated.

So I went fully knowing my flight could be cancelled. Of course multiple delays, the ground crew communicated with us multiple times, telling us they were doing what they could, that something had happened to their network. could have it been hacked? or challenges with having to cancel flights due to storm activity? Regardless, this airline wouldn't have cancelled if they felt the airways were safe, or they had the capacity. Then to our amazement they were able to organize the crew offline and get us on our flight home. These are trying times, shutdowns due to mysterious viruses, freaky weather.

Got on line, no flights to Manchester so I booked one to Boston that stopped in Tennessee first, I think that was Flt 3223 scheduled for 5:45 PM & landing after midnight. I took it. I will pay the $200 + for car service to get to New Hampshire. I went downstairs got my bags from the Manchester flt & checked them for the Boston Flight. Went through security again. At 3:30 that flight cancelled. They told me I could rebook for Monday morning flt 3159 several stops but you stay on the plane to Boston get in 6 hours later. I booked it. I was told my bags would be downstairs again. I went downstairs was told over & over again by the staff downstairs my bags would be down as soon as they could. 8 hours later when the baggage doors closed I was told no more bags coming down I could speak to a manager but there were no managers downstairs, I could go upstairs. I did & guess what, no manager there either. I went home bagless & exhausted. I asked at least ten time & was told the bags will be here. There was no real security watching these bags I had the Christmas gifts for my family in one bag & all my winter clothes in the other. I would have left, if I felt they would be secure. I wish I had. I stayed home Christmas my 3rd flt was cancelled. I tried calling Southwest on hold the first time 3 hours had to hang up & then 4 hours on hold & then disconnected. I went back to the airport on 12/26. Got on line 7:15AM to try again, to get a flt. to Manchester. I was on that line for 4.5 hours. The reason it was so long is that we were not important to Southwest They had 3- sometimes 4 employees at the counter & 3 & sometime all 4 of the Southwest employees would take the A list people that just walked into there lane, that haven't waited more then 5 minutes. So basically the group of over 150 to over 200 people were left with sometimes, one person, who was at the end of the counter, to assist them in finding a new flight. How disgusting!

Now, I go downstairs to get my luggage, you know it, not happening. Its no where to be found, so what are my options a line, 2 hours later, I get into the luggage counter and ask, where is my luggage? My last flight was flight cancelled yesterday? Well the young man says, one bag in is Boston & one is still in Tampa. I didn't go to Boston but my bag got a spot? I told him the other bag is not here I looked for it several times. He said well it could be on a cart somewhere & we don't have the staff to look for it. You had the staff to send one of them to Boston? Was it an A list bag? I asked how do I get my bags? He said once you land in Manchester you can request your bags. What? Now you want me to get in line in another state? I know that Boston doesn't fly to Manchester? So what you're telling me, is they will fly my bags somewhere else & then to Manchester? Do I get the mileage points or do my bags get them?

So, on 7/12/2023, one of us used the spirit app to check the terms and payment deduction detail of cancellation because we want to decide whether to cancel or change or just keep it in order protect my benefits. In the app, she clicked the button ""modify my trip"", i.e., cancel or change my trip. It then led her to the cancel button. But she didn't expect after clicking this, the app switched to the website and after uploading a while it cancelled my flights directly and automatically without providing us with the terms and results and the payment detail. Then it led her back to my app, our trip information is all gone. And after the system cancelled our reservation without getting our permission, later the spirit sent an email to Jingyao Li who paid the tickets with a form of money deduction detail and a 10-dollar voucher. How dare they to do this without mentioning us about the fee detail and results in the app and when it switched to the cancellation processing on the website. We have spent 394.54 dollars, but in the end, we are forced to be given a 10-dollar voucher for future Spirit trip. If we were informed that we cannot get refund and the payment detail of cancellation when clicking the button in the app, we would have not used to app to click it. The Spirit company has the obligation to notice the customers about the fee detail and terms agreement option when they click cancel button to let them know the detail not just cancelling directly and automatically without customer's permission. Besides, there are three of us. The app didn't provide us with the chance to decide whether to keep it or more changes but directly switched to the website and cancelled all of our reservation. It was crazy and unbelievable. we tried hard immediately to contact with the staff, but they said the website showed flights were cancelled and they can do nothing for us. So, what's the point of asking the staff for help if everything the company relies on is the non-customer friendly website and tricky app. Due to their refusal of any help about our case, we have to rebook and reschedule our trip. Our request is that Spirit gives us full refunds of this payment fee $394.54. We were very disappointed because we got nothing, no flights, no service and no help.

Spirit Airlines,1,"""Most horrible airline ever""","3 friends and I planned to fly from Boston to Santo Domingo on June 22nd via Orlando and had the most horrible experience. Flight NK2086 from Boston to Orlando was delayed by about 2 hours, and although we asked ground staff and stewards on the plane to communicate with the plane in Orlando so they could wait for us, they ignored our requests. When we landed in Orlando and got out of the plane (after it was delayed another 20 or so minutes because the gate was occupied), I heard an announcement that boarding would close for the SDQ flight in 1 minute. I sprinted to the next gate followed by at least 8 others trying to make our connection, only to find the ground staff at the gate to close the door as we arrived. We were then told to go to the counter to rebook our flight. It was at least a 1hr wait in line because there were so many stranded Spirit passengers from various flights, and by the time it was our turn, the alternative flight we had seen online was already full. The staff told the 4 of us we were already rebooked for the same flight the next day, meaning a 24 hour wait. Since we didn't have that time and didn't want to be stuck at the airport for 24 hours, we asked to be refunded for the missed flight and our bag fees. I asked if they would cover our hotel (and potentially meals) since we would have to stay overnight at the airport (especially if we would have gone with the offered alternative of waiting 24 hrs). They said no, I asked if we should sleep on the ground and they said yes. We ended up booking a flight with a different carrier that left early morning, still forcing us to spend the night at the airport and no sleep. Plus losing a night at the AirBnB that I paid for in Santo Domingo. Besides this horrible customer service and no compensation for the whole situation, on the way back it got worse. One of my 3 friends already planned to go back to Boston on Tuesday June 27 instead of Thursday June 29, but with the same flights. When he arrived at the airport, he found that the staff had canceled the entire rest of the reservation instead of just the one leg of flight we missed. Even though he had his flights in the Spirit app in his itinerary the entire time up to when he got to the airport. So he ended up being stuck at the airport for another night and having to book at his own expense another flight (very expensive last minute), and it took him a total of 2,5 days to make it back to Boston. The rest of us didn't want to be in this situation and ended up booking another flight since we didn't trust the app, because it had still shown the reservation for him as well. When confronting Spirit about all of this mess and the extra costs incurred, they took zero accountability for the lack of communication between flights. They refunded a small amount for the missed flight on the way there and gave some travel credit (why would I ever fly with them again), but not for bags ($100 each way!), or any of the expenses incurred with booking new flights, missed time and food/lodging.

I’ve worked in the Airline industry before actually as a Transportation manager for a catering company that actually serviced Spirit Airlines out of LAX. This was my 1st time actually flying on Spirit and I had my reservations about doing so, just based on the reputation but I placed my faith in believing my experience would be different. Yesterday I arrive at LAX for my flight to San Juan Puerto Rico about 2 hours prior to departure. I head to kiosk to print my boarding passes, and when I put in my confirmation #. I received a message that I’m checking in too early and my flight is scheduled to leave tomorrow - please see an agent. So then I must stand in this line to get to an agent for over an hour. I learned my connecting flight to Detroit was cancelled. When I finally got the counter the agent told me that my next flight out is in 2 days. My trip was from Monday to Friday now this issue has caused me to lose 3 days out of my trip and if I flew out Wednesday night I basically would turn right back around. I was looking forward to this 1st time trip to Puerto Rico but it looks like that has been delayed. The only options I had was to take the flight change or refund. Obviously I had to do the refund as I was losing on my reserved hotel room that I had for this 2 days, and honestly there was no way I was going to go through the nightmare of getting home. I cut my loses and then proceeded with a refund. As much as I had planned and anticipated the trip all the joy was lost. At the time I’m writing this I should have already landed and been taking in the island but since my vacation was canceled I returned back to work for a vacation I had planned for months. Next step is waiting for my full refund. When I initially purchased the tickets it wasn’t about the price of the ticket but the time of the flights that fit well with my schedule.

Spirit Airlines,1,"""the entire experience left much to be desired""","Disappointing Experience with Spirit Airlines and Expedia.com. I recently booked a flight for my sound engineer on Spirit Airlines through Expedia.com, and unfortunately, the entire experience left much to be desired. I had planned a trip from San Antonio, Texas to Norfolk over the weekend, which involved four flights due to layovers. However, my disappointment began when Spirit Airlines abruptly canceled the trip on the day of departure at 5:30 am, citing a lack of staff. This lack of preparedness and consideration for their customers time and plans was extremely frustrating. One would expect that in such circumstances, the airline would provide a refund or alternative arrangements for affected passengers. Unfortunately, this was not the case for my return trip. Despite the cancellation being caused by Spirit Airlines, they refused to issue a refund. This kind of inflexibility and lack of accountability is certainly disappointing, especially during these trying times where every penny counts. One of the reasons I had chosen Spirit Airlines was its reputation for affordable fares, but the overall experience has made me question whether the potential savings are worth the frustration and inconvenience. Moreover, the lack of customer support and understanding from the airline only exacerbates the negative experience. Additionally, I want to express my dissatisfaction with Expedia.com, the platform through which I made the booking. While I understand that they act as a middleman between customers and airlines, I expected better assistance and support in such a situation. It would have been helpful if they had intervened on my behalf to secure a refund or explore alternative options. In conclusion, my experience with Spirit Airlines and Expedia.com was highly disappointing. The last-minute cancellation by Spirit Airlines due to staff shortages, coupled with their refusal to provide a refund for the return trip, demonstrates a lack of responsibility and customer-centric approach.

Spirit Airlines,2,"""I wish I had read reviews""","I wish I had read reviews before purchasing a flight from Spirit Airlines. I thought I was getting a bargain on bringing my bike for $75 round trip. Turns out that was only one way, so it was actually $150 round trip, but that was just the beginning. After multiple gate and time changes, my return flight was cancelled at 2a. I stood in line for 2 plus hours with other people from a total of four cancelled flights. By 430a, I was rebooked on the earliest flight available, the red eye that night. I spent money on a Lyft back to the area of the city that I was familiar with, and was lucky enough by 8a to connect with a friend who let me charge my phone and laptop at their office so I could book a place to shower and nap. If my time itself is not included, I lost $350 on an AirBnB, Lyft rides and meals. If you value my time spent on this endeavor, and I do, add on another $240. Altogether taking a chance on Spirit Airlines cost me an extra $437 (paid for non-existent wifi access on return flight, bike return, extra meals, place to stay and cab/Lyft rides) out of pocket and another minimum $240 in opportunity costs. So not only did I not save money, I spent way more on this Spirit Airlines trip than booking my trip on American Airlines would have cost me. On a positive note, I interacted with over a dozen polite, cheerful and helpful employees of the airline. Two were obnoxiously rude and antagonistic, one so much so that because of her alone I would hesitate to fly with Spirit Airlines again.

That said, I have never experienced a worse airline anywhere in the world and I strongly recommend that you pay whatever the cost to travel by any other airline but Spirit. I chose them to travel to Virginia from Texas because the flight times were convenient and my outgoing flights worked just as planned. My return flight experience was a total nightmare. The hub for Spirit is Ft. Lauderdale Fl. When I checked my luggage in Richmond, My bag was one pound over the 40 lb. limit and the Spirit representative told me i would have to remove and carry items to reduce the weight or pay for a second bag. That was only the beginning but it was the least of my problems. We flew to Ft. Lauderdale for my connecting flight to Austin, and right up to departure time the monitor at the gate said the flight was on time. At the time the flight was supposed to be boarding I asked the representative at the gate if I had missed an announcement of a delay and she said the flight was cancelled. There was nothing on the monitor to indicate the flight was not leaving. She was rude and unhelpful when I asked if there were later flights. I found a customer service desk for Spirit and the two women reps were chatting and ignored me for several minutes. When one of them checked on flights to Austin, she said my best option was to fly to Baltimore and connect to Austin there, getting me home at midnight instead of 6 pm. So I waited for 5 hours to fly to Baltimore and when I got there I found that the flight to Austin was not the same day. I had to spend the night. In Baltimore i asked a Spirit rep if they could recommend a hotel and she was rude and said I should have arranged that in Ft. Lauderdale. By this time it was midnight since the plane was late leaving Ft. Lauderdale. A woman in baggage claim helped me identify a hotel and I spent $20 on a cab and $140 on a hotel. The next morning I flew to Austin and of course my luggage was lost. So by the time I got home, without my luggage I had been traveling for 26 hours for the flight that was supposed to take 5 hours with a layover. The Spirit employees main goal is to get you out of their face. I thought it was due to poor training, but I soon realized that they already know the system doesn't work to help their passengers so they don't even try. They just cop an attitude and tell you your out of luck. And if you call on the phone, the call center is somewhere where no-one speaks English. Not a coincidence. It is part of the system. This trip was the most expensive I have ever incurred flying to Richmond where my daughter lives. In the end for the cost of the tickets, the baggage fees, the seat fees and the hotel and cab fare, I spent more than $800. I could have flown 1st class on any other carrier for less. The stress and exhaustion of traveling for 26 hours and being treated horribly by every Spirit employee is something I can't describe other than as my worst nightmare. The Department of Transportation needs to do something to end the abusive practices of Spirit Airlines. They claim to be an economical airline but in fact they are a bait and switch business.

Two days before my trip, I got sick and had to cancel my trip to Florida. While I understand that cancellation policies are a necessity for businesses to run efficiently, I was dismayed by the lack of flexibility shown by Sun Country. They offered me a travel voucher for my flight cancellation, subtracting a $150 fee, which I accepted despite it seeming like a high cancelation fee. I must now book a flight within a year. However, the real bone of contention lies with the rental car I booked through them. Sun Country refused to issue a refund for the rental car since it was less than 2 days from departure, a policy that I find exorbitantly unfair and far from customer-friendly. I also contacted Avis, the rental car company; I discovered they would have only billed me upon car pick-up, indicating that my cancellation incurred no loss on their part. To add to my frustration, I found that the rental car pricing offered by Sun Country was more expensive than alternatives like Expedia or Kayak. It became evident that these other platforms provided better pricing and allowed for cancellation without charges. Reflecting on this experience, I regret bundling auto rental services with Sun Country Airlines. The lack of transparency, customer consideration, and higher costs was disheartening and left a bitter taste.

Our son was excited because he's an aspiring pilot and he had never flown with Sun Country before. The night before our flight I looked up the flight information to get the gate and found out the flight had been cancelled. Not sure when it was cancelled, but it was after we had checked in earlier in the day. Because we were in Seattle the customer service desk was already shut down for the day so we had to wait until the next morning to get help. The customer service rep was very kind and helpful (the only reason to give an average customer service rating). She confirmed the cancellation was due to crew issues. The next available flight for our family was in 7 days which is obviously not a valid option. She did offer a full refund and we have received that. But we had to rebook 5 new tickets for the next day which also added another hotel night and rental car day. It cost us an additional $2500. The flight experience may be perfectly fine, and I do believe the rep did everything she was allowed to do. But if you are booking with them be fully aware you could be stranded or incur a significant expense if your flight is cancelled and they aren't able to offer a timely replacement.

After waiting for 3 hours to talk to a customer service rep, a $100 flight voucher to be used within a year was offered.

After spending hours on the phone during my vacation and being assured several times that my bag would be delivered to me once it arrived on Saturday, it finally arrived on Saturday and I was informed that Sun Country doesn’t have agreements in place with any of the delivery carriers at the Vancouver airport so they could not in fact deliver it to me. I spent another 2+ hours to travel to the airport to pick it up, where I was met with empty Sun Country desks and an airport information desk employee who insisted there was nothing he could do to help although my bag was at that very same airport.

Sun Country Airlines,1,"""lack of concern for their customers""","We booked a ski trip to Bozeman with a return on Sunday morning 2/27/22. However, three weeks prior to our trip S.C. canceled our return flight without explanation. Most likely they just didn't think the flight was full enough. They booked us on their evening flight for that day. So instead of a return flight at 10:30 AM we were stuck with a return of 7:30 PM. This of course caused lots of headaches with car rentals, hotel check out times, etc. On the day of our return, we got a notice that our flight was delayed until 8:30. Then an hour prior, we got another notice that our flight was delayed until 9:00 PM. Finally, at about 9:15 PM we departed. Upon landing back at MSP, at midnight, we sat on the tarmac for a full hour without any (none, zero, zilch) communication as to why we were sitting there or what was going on. So instead of getting home at 1:30 PM on Sunday afternoon like we planned, we got home at 2:00 AM Monday morning - and really for no good reason at all. No weather, no mechanical delays, no explanations. Sun Country doesn't appear to care about you. They will cancel your flight on a moment's notice, delay you without explanation and make you sit on the tarmac without any communication.

Sun Country Airlines,1,"""avoid this sorry excuse of an airline""","I would avoid this sorry excuse of an airline at all costs. I booked my flight out of SFO - MSP - BOS on 12/30, leaving around midnight. Around 7pm the same day, I get one text saying the flight was going to be delayed 2 hours. Worried about missing my connecting flight, I call their customer service center about 10 times to no avail. I get to the airport early, and their desk isn't even open until 9pm. I talk to the agent, who confirms I will miss my connecting flight from Sun Country, then offers a ""refund of flight"" or ""flight on 1/2 out of MSP."" Refund of flight is useless, as all the other last minute flights are 2-3x more expensive. An alternate flight 3 days later is a joke, given Sun Country doesn't offer any hotel accommodations and basically wants to leave a customer stranded in a random city for 3 days. I eat up the cost of an exorbitantly more expensive last minute flight, and follow up with their customer service via email, phone, SNS multiple times. No response for 3 weeks. Then, I get an email saying like ""we're really sorry, so as a sign of our commitment to excellent customer service, we've refunded you your original ticket price."" This almost feels insulting, that the only remuneration offered is the money for the flight I never got to set foot on due to a malfunctioning or error on Sun Country's part. I call again - maybe 3-4 times because their customer service is impossible to reach. The agent tells me she'll look into it. I get an email a few days later saying ""Sorry, we're not going to do anything."" They don't care about their customers. They don't care about their commitments or flight schedules. They are definitely not a well-functioning airline, and they are hardly a business at all run based on a modicum of common sense.

After my experience with this company I felt it was important to leave a review for those like me that have severe flying anxiety. My first interaction with this company after booking happened when I noticed that I failed to put middle names on my booking so our boarding passes would not match our passports. I called the service number and left my call back number. I had already read that no one answers the phone so I was prepared to be disappointed by not receiving a call back. A couple of hours later a young lady called me back and I explained my mistake. Her response was ""Well let's get that corrected so you can be at ease have a great trip."" She corrected 4 middle names on my booking and emailed me a new itinerary while staying on the phone with me to make sure everything looked ok. Disaster averted. We then got to the airport on Sunday to find out our flight was delayed. Again, after reading the horror stories of delayed flights being cancelled and people being left to fend for themselves I began to feel very high anxiety. One of my adult children would be flying from a different airport but same airline into Mexico and I was afraid she'd be in Mexico by herself. The flight was an hour late but finally showed up, they very calmly unloaded the passengers coming into Houston and got us all on the plane as quickly and well organized as I've ever seen. The flight attendants personally apologized to the passengers as we boarded for being late explaining that there were severe storms at their last stop and that they had to wait it out. I don't even know where to begin about our experience with our flight home. From Mexico, coming back into America, you must check in at the counter to show your negative covid test. Of all the check in counters, it was the shortest line, the staff was friendly and very patient with everyone, and they went above and beyond to help us get checked in and to our terminal in time. Wonderful service. I have flown on several airlines and take several trips a year and this is probably one of the best experiences I have had flying (that included set backs). There's a lot of bashing this airline for things that anyone could avoid just by doing their research or reading their booking information. The seating is no different than other airlines. The drinks come with a cup of ice just like every other airline. Oh there's phone chargers on the backs of the seat legs which I have never seen before. That was cool. We got free WiFi. Being surprised by carry on and check bag fees baffles me. This isn't uncommon. Check these things BEFORE you book and there will be no surprises with this airline.

Sun Country Airlines,1,"""I was so disappointed""","I am writing based on an a poor experience I had with a Sun Country Airlines flight credit/voucher. Back in January 2020 I had made a flight reservation for my family from Denver to Minnesota for May 7, 2020. However because of the safety and health concerns and overall halt of essentially all activities related to the COVID pandemic, Sun Country offered me the opportunity to cancel my flight and for which I was issued a credit for future use. I was very pleased and grateful at the level of customer service Sun Country offered in such uncertain times-outside of anyone's control.

After waiting for over an hour on the phone to talk to a customer service rep, I was met with hostility and an absolute disregard and resounding lack of accommodation or alternative to my situation. I consider traveling by air an expensive privilege and one that I am extremely grateful for but one I do not have the luxury of doing so very often. I am also conscious of cancelation/rescheduling charges and terms during normal times but during these unprecedented times, I think it is so important for businesses to value their customers and vise versa. I was so disappointed at the lack of transparency by Sun Country when this credit was issued and I was not fully informed that the credit would expire. The lack of transparency by Sun Country coupled with the uncertainty of traveling until deemed safe by CDC and federal officials made planning future plans almost impossible and now that it seems like the nation is in the clear, Sun Country has made it unattainable for me.

I called customer service recently to look up my credit, and it had supposedly expired a month prior. I was told there was nothing I could do about this. Sun Country took our money, cancelled our flight, refused to give a refund, and is now refusing to let us reschedule. Reading other reviews, I see I am not the only one having this experience.

Sun Country Airlines,1,"""I was so disappointed in this whole experience""","We have flown Sun Country for years and have always had pretty good experiences. Well, that officially ended today. We booked a short trip before the pandemic to get a little break from our toddler before our second baby came. We never actually went on the trip though: Sun Country cancelled the flight because of the pandemic. Fine. We understood. My husband immediately called Sun Country to see if we could get a refund. They refused but did send us an email about an electronic credit we could use toward a future booking. There was nothing in the email about the credit expiring. Today, I tried to use the credit toward a new flight. The website said the voucher was worth $0. So I called the helpline and spent over two hours on hold and speaking to two different agents (after getting hung up on by the first one when being ""transferred"" to a supervisor). First they tried to say we couldn't use the credit because their records showed that my husband had cancelled the flight, which isn't true. We booked through Bookit.com, and they sent us an email saying they would cancel the flight within the next 7 days if Sun Country didn't cancel it first. My husband didn't call until the flight was actually cancelled. Once we had that established, they said it didn't matter because the credit was only valid for a year from the date it was issued. I told them the email we received about the credit had no expiration date or even a disclaimer that it would expire at all. They said they sent two more emails about it expiring, which we conveniently never received. After getting hung up on by the first agent who was supposed to be transferring me to her supervisor, I had to call back and wait on hold for another 30 minutes to start the whole process over again with a new agent, who said her supervisor had reviewed our case and denied the credit, so she wouldn't even speak to me. I told the second agent I was so disappointed in this whole experience that we wouldn't be flying with them in the future, and she said, ""I understand. Is there anything else I can help you with?"" Yep-you can transfer me to Delta Airlines.

Swoop had an early afternoon flight (as did AC and WestJet, but we wouldn't be able to sit together). We booked it with extras - checked & cabin baggage, priority boarding. When the agent took our bags only then were we advised that the flight was delayed several hours. Although it was about 2 hours before the flight was originally scheduled to depart Vegas, the inbound aircraft had not even yet left Toronto. The departure was ultimately put off to 5:30 pm and we were each given a $10 meal voucher for our trouble. My originally booked flight, which I had to cancel, departed on time at 5:05. (Flair). When the aircraft arrived at the gate, the boarding process began with our zone 1. We passed through boarding pass scanning, and were met with a long line of people waiting to board in the jetway. We were towards the back of the line, near the entrance to the jetway. We waited there about 15 - 20 minutes before some people in hi-vis jackets passed by us and then quickly came out to abruptly tell us the flight was cancelled. We immediately re-booked on the later, red-eye AC Rouge flight 1704 (which was excellent and on-time, by the way). We had to be in Buffalo by 11am on Saturday. That red-eye was our last chance to meet that deadline. Swoop later emailed us with a link to book an overnight room and rebooked our flight to the next morning, Saturday Nov. 12, at 10am.

It has now been well over 72 hours with no communication whatsoever from the airline in response to our many inquiries, and no real way to reach them. You are better off walking. Although Swoop said that the delay was somehow due to customs & immigration delays (even though the passengers on the inbound flight YYZ - LAS would have all precleared US customs in Toronto), I suspect that the real issue was that the delay had taken the crew out of its allowed time for service, and they had a mandatory rest period before the flight could resume on its way back to Toronto. Why do I think so? Because I sure didn't see any new crew show up and I was at that gate literally from 11:30 am - 5:30pm.

This is a common scheme of low cost airlines that I have been all too familiar with, but TAP goes above and beyond with their policies of unfair fees for passengers, leaving them with the option of paying or being stranded.

I explained that I had never heard of that in my life (how would a sign help if you're not at the airport yet) but was ignored (I later complained to someone else who explained this was when they opened and was only an advised time - I showed him the TC website which states the standard 3 hours and told him how rude his colleague had been). The agent did not apologise or show any empathy or understanding. A colleague came over to explain further and provide a $10 meal voucher but also did not apologise or seem to care very much. She pointed out they are just third party staff and to contact TC. A little later I went back to complain to a manager and the agent just said there wasn't one. Then nothing, we just stood there.

Thomas Cook Airlines,4,"""like long haul Ryanair""","Manchester to New York JFK return. This was the most stressful outbound flight experience I have had. I arrived over 2 hours early for my flight to NY and was greeted by absolute chaos in the Manchester check in area - enormous queues of passengers just not moving and angry ""priority"" passengers yelling at staff as normal queues were moving faster than them. Eventually they opened more desks and things got moving but it was nearly an hour by the time I got to check in. Outbound my hand luggage was 8kg (so 2kg over the 6kg luggage allowance) which I hadn't realised as I booked the flight the day before for a surprise visit my fiancé had planned. Most other airlines have a 10kg hand luggage allowance so the 6kg is unreasonably restrictive IMO, and is clearly not a safety thing as ""premium"" passengers are allowed 10kg. As we were only going for the weekend I had packed a trolley case with very little inside and since my partner lives in the states I took the chance to use my baggage allowance to pack some items we had not yet been able to take out there like bedding etc which was in a sealed box. The guy on the desk was adamant I had to lose 2kgs or pay £95 to check in my hand baggage. I asked if I could pay per kilo I was overweight as I had no way to repack the sealed box and could not afford to pay the extortionate check-in fee which is higher than additional baggage charges I have paid on other airlines when I genuinely have had to check a bag in. He was (rudely) adamant no. So I relented and said well if I had to transfer into my checked bag which was only 15kg then I needed scissors and tape to open and reseal the box. ""Not his problem"" apparently, and I was told I had to find somewhere else in the terminal to do it or pay the £95. Long story short the baggage storage counter was nice enough to let me use their stuff but I think the rudeness and disorganisation of the staff and stingy, inflexible and ridiculously expensive baggage policy is enough to put off flying with them again. By the time I got my bag checked the flight was boarding and I had to run through security to get to the gate. Had the same enormous check-in queue issue at JFK on the return leg, where the queue at 7pm for a 10pm flight was so large they had a separate side queue area before you got to the queues at the front of the desks. Credit to the 5 desk staff there though it did move reasonably quickly. My in-flight experience was supposedly better than normal due to them issuing a free upgrade to ""premium"" entertainment which was frankly poor in comparison with other airlines I've recently flown to USA with (Delta, Icelandair). On the return I had 5 films to choose from. Food was ok, but no complimentary drinks except a bottle of water and trolley drinks are expensive. There was a constant push to sell you stuff - you have to sit through 4 adverts back to back before you can watch anything. It really is like long haul Ryanair but with a stricter baggage policy. It took an hour after landing for my bag to come into reclaim so having got through immigration that was a 40minute wait, meaning I missed a train connection by 2mins. The gate from JFK also had no seats and we had to be bussed out across to the plane which was miles away. In summary - a totally budget experience which could be so much better if they could sort out check in and be slightly more reasonable on hand luggage weight allowance.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,5/1/2018,Dissatisfied,Satisfied,Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,New York JFK,Manchester,TRUE,United Kingdom,FALSE,International
Thomas Cook Airlines,8,"""a bargain and the flight was fine""","Boston to Manchester with a scheduled departure time of 17:35 with an arrival time of 04:55 the next morning. I checked on the punctuality of this route and found that the plane often took off about 15 minutes early but almost always arrived on time or a bit earlier. That was the case with my flight. Cabin baggage in economy is limited to 6 kg. My carry on bag was easily 15 kg but since I was not checking a bag I figured that once I checked in I would simply print my boarding pass and go directly to the gate. I know Logan airport well and there are no scales at the gates. But I was wrong. It is impossible to print a boarding pass from home. Everyone must go to the check in counter. Because of this, I had to check in one bag and make sure that my carry on was under 6 kg. I also put my laptop in another small bag which the check in person didn't see. Once my bag was weighted no one ever questioned it or inspected it. I could have had a friend waiting for me and simply stuffed my bag after checking in, or simply left my bag with my friend and arrived with no bag whatsoever. So beware. You must be careful as they weigh all carry on bags at Boston. The flight was fine. Free meal (chicken or beef) and free muffin and coffee before landing. Everything else costs money. Cans of beer were 4GBP! No individual screens on the seat backs, just drop down screens like in the 1970s. No problem. Seats were a bit tight but otherwise fine. Staff was lovely.

Turkish Airlines,1,"""do not know what I did wrong""","At the end of January I wanted to book flights online for the end of April to Turkey in such a way that we first fly from Prague to Istanbul, stay there for a week and then continue to Antalya for another week and then from Antalya back to Prague via Istanbul. But you can't book that online like that, so I called TK customer service and asked how I should book that. The information was that I should book 2 tickets and reserve min 3 hours on the way back for the change in Istanbul. I did as instructed, booked the tickets and also had over 3 hours to change planes, arriving in IST 13:40, departing to PRG 16.45. In the weeks and months that followed, I kept getting text messages from TK saying they were changing the schedule, changing planes, etc. Most of them concerned changes of times because of the time change to daylight saving time, but one concerned the flight from AYT to IST where I was secretly rebooked on a later flight, which I unfortunately did not notice. There remained however still 1 h 45 min for the change, which is well enough. Already on the way to the airport I saw that the flight will be delayed. At the check-in, however, the boarding pass was issued to us also for IST-PRG and the luggage was checked through to PRG. The delay was then according to TK on 1 h 16 min, so quite that is not true, we took a long time to the arrival gate, where we arrived at 16:20. Already on the plane I asked several times how it would work with the connection and the last information was that I should grab the first TK employee at the exit and let him advise me. I did and the TK man at the gate told me to go to the departure gate as quickly as possible. Anyone who knows the new IST airport knows what that means. Nevertheless, we made it to the gate by 16:45 (we are both 68 years old and my last gold medal in the 5000 m run was several decades ago). But of course there was not a soul at the gate. Again I grabbed a TK employee, who referred me to the customer service counter, where of course the obligatory queue was waiting. When I showed the ""Pre-sorter"" my boarding passes, he told me immediately that no more flight today and I should wait here, so that TK look for a hotel and book new tickets. When it was my turn, the lady looked at my papers only briefly, and explained to me that I had no right to any compensation because I had booked 2 tickets. No one responded to my question about how I should have booked and they referred me to the ticket counter next door, where I had to wait almost 45 minutes for my turn. For 2 tickets to Prague they wanted $700! When I went to book the tickets online, I came up with around $500, but the lady told me she couldn't take that fare and I should book online. With the hotel and cab and dinner this story came me to over 600 € about 200 € more than the whole original booking. Since then I have been arguing with TK, repeating everything I'm sure 10 times already, but all I ever get to hear is the gramophone record: ""You were late at the gate and had 2 tickets, we are not to blame"". On my question, how I should have booked differently, is consistent just as little addressed as also to the fact that the TK customer service had advised me to do so.

I couldn’t get credit for the second leg, even though they only canceled the second leg. I moved my flight to one day earlier and left my trip on may 2nd causing me to incur charges for the hotel stay for a night I couldn’t use. Day of the flight the flight was delayed over an hour with only a 2 hour connection to my second flight on their airline. I asked if I would miss the connection and they stated I would not and the plane would be held because we would land about 6pm and the flight started boarding at 6:50 pm instead of holding the plane they had an agent get me off the plane as soon as we landed and I thought I was being rushed to my flight, but no they were rushing me to the lounge because they had already booked me on another flight the next day. So I lost another day of my vacation because I had to stay overnight in Istanbul. I also had to get a visa for Istanbul unexpectedly because I had to leave the airport. None of this was explained to me it all just happened. On May 2nd my return flight, we were headed to the airport and our cab driver told us our flight was delayed 2 hours. No email or text form Turkish airlines. We get inside the airport and flight still shows on time, I call Turkish and they said it was on time. Got to the counter and was told by that the flight was in fact delayed 2 hours and we would miss our connection and they knew about it 4 hours prior to me asking. So why weren’t we told because again we are going to miss our connection to their next flight. So I asked to be booked on the flight for the 4th because the flight on the 3rd was canceled (my original flight home).

Turkish Airlines,1,"""the worst travel experience of our lives""","We were loyal Turkish Airlines fliers for many years until this experience. Our saga started when we purchased 4 business class segments for my wife and my honeymoon in February 2022 for almost $8K. Due to Covid, we tried to change them over the course of the next year. This airline has arbitrary change fees that are not listed anywhere on their website. They are allowed to quote you whatever fees they would like at the time of the change request. As such, we were told that our new tickets would need to be roughly $5600 to qualify for the change, with an additional $600 per ticket change fees, so $9k in total for a $5600 flight. We agreed, but disputed the change fee with Amex. Amex found in our favor for $600, issuing the credit and we looked forward to our honeymoon. Fast forward, we arrived to the gate in February 2023 for our new flight and were told for the first time that our tickets were *suspended* and that we no longer had tickets. After speaking to ticketing agents and phone agents, both of which said there was nothing they could do (more on this later) we finally were able to speak to the Newark sales manager who was highly unprofessional and unhelpful, trying to convince us that we were not owed anything and essentially ""too bad"". In the end, we were forced to purchase last minute economy tickets for almost $4K with a one way upgrade for $2500, as we did not want to jeopardize our hotel reservation and ruin our honeymoon further. Over the course of the next 2 weeks, like many here, we emailed the feedback form many times (as others noted, this airline's phone personnel have no authority to make any financial decisions and all must be done via online feedback forms). We received many unhelpful responses, refusing to give us any compensation or help us in any way. All references were made to speak to ""our bank."" Finally, we decided to upgrade our economy leg home for another $2500 and take this matter up when we got home. In the end, we paid about $8600 just to have to pay another $8.5K and fly in two 8 hour economy segments versus the 4 business segments we originally purchased. I'm sure that in the meantime, Turkish resold our original seats last minute for much higher than the original $8k we paid 5 months before the flight. In short, this was the worst travel experience of our lives and showed clearly the unethical business practices of this airline. 1) They will suspend your tickets without notice, forcing customers to purchase last minute segments at the gate. There are numerous other cases here of flier having their tickets arbitrarily suspended. 2) You will not be able to make changes, receive refunds or do any customer service action of any value through the phone with them. You will be forced to use an antiquated online ""feedback form"" that does not even track your previous correspondence. There are no personnel in any airport, including in Istanbul that have the authority to issue flight changes, credits or refunds. 3) They do not have a clear change fee policy. If you need to change your flight, be prepared to spend months trying to communicate with them on the aforementioned form and in the end they can quote you any amount, you're on your own.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,3/1/2023,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Newark,İstanbul,TRUE,Türkiye,FALSE,International

United Airlines,1,"""wouldn't conceive flying Polaris again""","Polaris class SFO-PPT and back. Never again. First, check-in for Polaris at SFO was surreal, with 50+ people on line and only one agent actively checking Polaris-class passengers in. I found myself longing for the business-class check-in desks at the other, non-U.S. carriers in the International Terminal, carriers that actually seem to offer a premium service to people who have paid for it. I arrived at the terminal two hours before my United flight but got only 20 minutes in the lounge as a result of this mess. Second, United's boarding process is a slap in the face to passengers who pay upwards of $7000 for a seat in Polaris. If you're not a member of one of their frequent-flyer levels, you're forced to board with economy-class passengers. Every other airline in existence lets passengers in the premium cabin board first, before the coach stampede starts with people pushing and shoving to board so they can get first claim to overhead space. This is one reason why I will never fly United again. Third, my berth in Polaris was filthy, with lint and crumbs littering the air vent along the bulkhead. Fourth, the food in Polaris was virtually inedible. Again, when you're paying upwards of $7000 for a ticket, you expect something that isn't going to make you gag.

Our departure to SFO was delayed by 3 hours because the flight crew was delayed getting in to DFW and needed their 8 hour rest. This meant we would miss our connection. As it turned out, the connecting flight was cancelled. The agent at check in would not rebook us on another airline nor put us on standby. Our bags were checked through to YVR. The agent in the United Club put us on standby for the next flight from SFO. Unfortunately, we could not get on this flight nor 2 other flights that we were on standby status. As a result, I ended up booking one way flights on another carrier to Seattle, stayed overnight and then took the bus to YVR so we could attend the first of 4 wedding events. The flight itself was fine; however, the baggage is another story. Our bags never made it to YVR. I spent countless hours texting with United Baggage over 5 days. We received conflicting messages about our bags being in YVR. We missed a pre-wedding soiree because we spent 4 1/2 hours at YVR airport looking for a bag that wasn't there and had to buy every day clothes plus clothes for the wedding. On Monday July 3, I received a phone call saying one bag as in YVR. I requested the bag to be delivered to our hotel. On the day of departure from YVR, the bag still hadn't arrived. I received a call while going through security that 2 bags would be sent to DFW and delivered to our home address. The bags were delivered to our home on Friday July 7. The garment bag that was supposed to be delivered to our hotel before departure on 7/6 is still in United's baggage system. 24-48 hr delay is excusable; however an entire 8 day vacation without baggage is totally inexcusable.

We have one of the largest Airports in America, therefore, I understand the 2 hours plus rule. From the time I arrived in Newark, it was a terrible choice. My first leg on United Airlines was ATL to EWR, I arrived to Hartsfield Airport (ATL) to discover my flight would be 1 hour and 45 mins delayed. Not a big deal to most but I had a connecting flight to Denmark, Europe. As it got closer to the boarding time, an United assistant began to yell on the microphone, ""Y'all have to hurry and board or we will go illegal and you will have to wait longer"". If anyone came up to ask a question, ""Y'all have to hurry and board because we are about to go illegal"". She informed us, they would start boarding sooner due to them about to go ""illegal"". Finally, we are all boarded on the plane, we waited an extra 30 mins to taxi due to them allowing another United flight that was supposed to depart at 10ish pm to board our flight, they said we were not full so they could get more passengers on my flight. While this delay occurred because we have multiple people with the same seat. These genius people did not think about this. Secondly, I arrived at Newark, and it takes United 30 mins to get an associate to hook up a ramp for passenger departure of the aircraft. The pilot continues to apologize over the microphone several times. I literally had 5 mins to get to my connecting flight; it was pointless to even run during this time. I reached the United help desk to informed them I'd missed my connecting flight due to their delay, the woman assisted me by trying to get the next available flight but all of them made me miss my anniversary, which is the day I would have arrived to be with my spouse. At this point, they give me a hotel because I had an international flight. I asked several times if my bags would be on the new flight I'd been given, the United assistant reassured me they would. (It was not on my next flight after delayed for 10 hours.) The assistant gave me a meal voucher of $15 for breakfast and lunch. They provided a Lyft to the hotel, by this time, it was 12 am. The hotel was about a 20 min drive, and I felt like I'd passed a million hotels to arrive at such an unsatisfying one. You would have thought I was in a motel 6. After a 10-hour delay, I started my travel back to Newark (EWR), my international flight was on time, I was so happy to be away from this unprofessional airport. The staff was horrible going through security check out. I arrived to Aalborg, Europe to discover, no one knew where my bags were. I'd missed my anniversary and now I have absolutely No clothes. Returning flight: From Aalborg, Europe (AAL) to dreadful Newark (EWR), I arrived at Newark Airport (EWR) again but this time I had an 8-hour layover. I'd learned from my first experience to just take the extra time if you can. I put myself into the Newark International Airport Marriott, which is only 5 mins from the Airport.

We were first delayed in the Salt Lake Airport for 8 1/2 hours, missing our connection by several hours and being forced to stay in San Francisco for about 16 hours until the next flight from there left to Tel Aviv. Now, this by itself was very frustrating and meant we would miss a whole day of our vacation, no vacation and no work meant we were losing money by the hour, add onto that was the unhelpful attitude of the flight crew, the several different reasons given for delays (ranging from weather to flight crew deficiency, to plane malfunctions) and this was just a really bad day. We stay in San Francisco for an entire day and are back at the airport for the new flight. Now, the airline did provide us with a hotel (pretty bad one that smelled like smoke) and a few food vouchers, but we weren't very happy with them. The next flight gets delayed again and again until finally at about 2am (was supposed to leave at 8), they cancel the flight for another set of ambiguous reasons. at this point, there are 400+ angry people waiting in one line with about 2 agents and they are turning people away without so much as a hotel room. At this point we decided we would not be flying United, we've missed two days of vacation or work, we've been treated poorly and compensated only the bare minimum. We finally speak to an agent and demand monetary compensation as well as a refund for the cancelled flight (airlines are required to refund cancelled flights), and they refuse. They tell us there will be compensation but where, when, how is left ambiguous. We ended up flying Delta, completely smooth as wonderful process.

By the time the tire was fixed, the crew was over their authorized hours, and the flight was canceled. We were told that we would be rebooked to our initial destination (Melbourne), but we were rebooked to Sydney, which is about 539 miles off our initial destination. In order to solve this, we were directed to another United customer service desk where we stood in line for an hour with 50+ United customers dealing with similar “rebooking” issues. It was 2:00 am by the time we were able to talk to a United customer service employee, and good god I wish we hadn’t. For two hours we stood at that counter and did not get a straight answer to our questions, ie.) He told us he booked tickets for our party of 4 on the same alternative route to Melbourne, but when we checked our itineraries, the flights were still destined for Sydney or, to our surprise, Brisbane. When we asked for the tickets to be printed, we were told there were only 2, even though all 4 of us at the counter repeatedly had to remind him there were 4 of us. On top of this, a customer that had been previously helped cut his way in line twice to commandeer Pax’s attention even though we requested he wait so we could have a chance to get our stuff sorted out as well. It was 4:30 am at this time, we were given a motel voucher by Pax, and told we had rooms booked for the night, but when we called the motel to verify, we were informed we had no bookings and there were no rooms available… Cots were eventually provided for customers that didn’t have any options other than spending the night in the airport, only to be collected about an hour and a half later… The United customer service line has been long and slow moving all day already, which indicates that these issues are still persisting, and United is not prioritizing the one thing it needs to: its customers.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,6/1/2023,Neutral,Very Satisfied,Neutral,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Asheville,Melbourne,TRUE,Australia,FALSE,International

United Airlines,1,"""refused to compensate us""","Shocking treatment by United Airlines of 2 elderly people and an infant, leaving us stranded and paying over $1,000 for hotel + food over the Boston Marathon weekend - and when we filed a complaint, United refused to compensate us even one cent! We were flying from Boston to Calgary, Canada via Newark with my two elderly parents (one of whom has a back problem and gastrointestinal issues) and my 5 month old baby, who was flying for the first time in his life. On the morning of our scheduled departure, United told us that the Boston-Newark leg of our journey was delayed because of an earlier delay impacting our plane’s arrival, meaning we would not have sufficient time to make our Newark-Calgary connection. We spent over 2.5 hours on the phone with United trying to find an alternative flight, but were informed that the earliest available alternative was not for another two days on April 18th, 2023, even though we showed great flexibility e.g. we were willing to connect via a different city, split our family up so we flew on different airplanes, and / or accept a longer connection time. Despite this, United said there was absolutely no option for us to fly for another 2 days. They also confirmed that the reason for the earlier delay was boarding of the aircraft taking longer than expected, which was within their control. We looked ourselves into flying with another airline, but the cost of such last-minute tickets was thousands of dollars per passenger and therefore prohibitively expensive. This meant cancelling our United flights and getting a refund was not a feasible solution. United did NOT offer us the option of arranging a flight with a different airline carrier without additional expense, which is contrary to our rights under Canada's Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR). We therefore accepted the new United itinerary on April 18th. We were appalled that United was not able to re-schedule us for two full days.  Our destination city of Calgary is not a small town - it has a population of 1.45 million people and a very active international airport. We were stuck in Boston during the very busy Boston Marathon weekend, which forced us to stay at an expensive hotel 2 more nights than we planned as we could not find last minute accommodation elsewhere. We incurred additional meal costs and transportation costs to the airport. Our total additional expenses during our delay period WAS USD 1,110. We filed a detailed complaint with United Customer Care. It took them close to 2 months to reply to us, and when they did they vaguely blamed the weather (first time we heard of this excuse!) and refused to compensate us at all.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,4/1/2023,Very Dissatisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Neutral,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Boston,Calgary,TRUE,Canada,FALSE,International

However, my return flight via Charlotte to London Heathrow, was a complete nightmare. We taxied to the run way on time to me told by the captain that a fault (which he said they knew about and should have already been fixed earlier that day) had occurred, it was nothing serious and we would go back to the stand for the system to be rebooted, then we would be on our way. Well, the reboot took place, pushed back from the stand to be told the fuel switch over light had come back on and we would have to return to the stand for engineers to take another look as reboot hadn't worked. Sat on stand for ages, then the captain said anyone who wished to leave the plane, to rearrange connecting flights, or to stretch their legs was welcome to do so and return to the plane at anytime. I was travelling with my disabled mother, but was worried as my father was due to travel 2hrs to collect us at Heathrow, and due to the time difference was about to leave her home in the UK. I asked a stewardess if it would be OK to leave my mom on the plane while I just step outside to make a call. Her words were ""no problem"". I left the plane and was told I had to go past the barriers at the departure gate, which I duly did. I managed to contact my father and asked the ground crew if I could return to the plane. The man was so rude and said no way, can't get back on the plane unless we tell you. I tried to explain that wasn't how it was told to us and I had my disabled mother onboard the aircraft, he shrugged his shoulder and walked away. I then noticed a woman staff member, who was talking to another couple, I waited at a distance, no saying a word as I didn't want to interrupt their conversation, but the women staff member turned to me and said, ""don't interrupt, I'll deal with you in a minute"". I was totally stunned at her attitude. Well, eventually I did get back on the plane but only after explaining about my mother and what the captain and stewardess had said. Eventually everyone was allowed back on board as we were told the plane had been fixed. Again we pushed back to be told fault had reappeared and engineers were going to replace a value. Again we were told it was fixed, pushed back, and, you guessed it, fault reappeared. This time we were told by the captain, even if the plane could be fixed a new crew would have to be found as they were now illegal to fly. This took place over 6hrs! One half filled cup of water and a packet of pretzels were given within those 6hrs. Then came the announcement, the flight was cancelled. Everyone got off, but my mother needed a wheelchair which took ages to come so by the time we got out to the departure gate we were last in the queue. Eventually given a flight home, 24hrs later, told couldn't get us a hotel as NASCAR was in town, given a cot to sleep on and $20 in food vouchers, but this was after midnight and no food outlets were open. When it was bought to the staff attention, the lukewarm food from the plane was given to us. My mother couldn't sleep in the cot provided so spent a sleepless night in her wheelchair.

The agent at the airport initially said it did and had me walk to the other side of the area, where it was not there. The second agent informed me that it was still in Philly but would get to me the next day. It did not. In a multitude of calls, I was informed it got to Frankfurt and they would forward to Paris immediately with no cost spared, then was informed that it was already in Paris, then still in Philly, then in Paris, then in Frankfurt and again in Paris. I gave an address 4-5 times and every call included them saying they didn't have one. Agents swore every day that I would have it. I had planned to travel around but my once in a lifetime vacation has been hijacked and ruined by having to spend loads of money to stay in one place and hours for luggage that never arrives. Safe to say I will never fly US Airways again.

Someone from the airline was checking the people with connecting flights to make sure they could still make it, he said we ""should"" make it. Well, we had a gut feeling ""should"" wasn't enough so we went to another counter. They said we would have to change our flight because we would only have 4 minutes to make it to a gate on the other side of the airport before the flight departed. We wouldn't have eaten calmly and taken our time to do things if we were told that to begin with! So they tell me we will have to stay an extra 5 hours sitting at the airport to our connecting flight or that we would have to pay for a hotel and stay the night in Charlotte, they wouldn't pay, but regardless I had to be in Charleston that night. So I asked to be refunded because it was not sounding like great options. There was a sweet lady that helped us and told us to let the flight attendant know we had to make our earlier flight as soon as we landed. However when we got onto the plane about 2 hours later, they delayed us another 30 minutes because of traffic. We wanted to leave, I would make it driving down south faster than flying (and a lot cheaper), but a nice lady on the plane saw how upset we were and helped calm us down. She then explained that we wouldn't be able to make it to our earlier flight, but that we could ask the help desk to get us seats on the 10:30 flight, or have the airline pay for our hotel to leave the next morning because the delay was due to ""maintenance"" issues. We had no choice so she met us as we landed and tried to help us find an airport nearby our original location for a friend to pick us up at. Her shift was over and was beyond sweet for helping us for so long. She actually found us a flight leaving 15 minutes after we landed but they wouldn't have been able to deliver our luggage. So we took the seats on the 10:30 flight and of course without sitting together (I get anxious so I always need someone, so my fiancé and I were upset).

Finally a young lady got up and moved her laptop so I could place my bag in the overhead. While struggling to lift my bag a gentleman sitting in a seat got up and helped me. Meanwhile the steward and stewardess were still standing in their spots! When I sat down the steward told people to put away their computers.

There was a complimentary Beverage service and a la carte snacks, However I found $4 US for a small pack of Pringles and $7US for a Tiny Bottle of Heineken a little steep. Seeing as this was a Domestic flight, I would understand the lack of IFE. There weren't any onboard power outlets on any aircraft. My Laptop died halfway through my flight to Philly.

Unfortunately, my trip back home was more unsatisfactory. Upon purchasing a small meal pack (I'm guessing the options were limited since it was only a 1.25 hour flight) and a cocktail, we were the last ones served (last seats on the plane). I feel as though delivering purchased products would be more of a priority. Perhaps assigning one person to deliver products while the other offers complimentary drinks would be more effective for customer service and efficiency. Maybe operationally that doesn't work for them because of cost but it compromises service. After receiving our order, the steward forgot an item and when I said excuse me and tried to tell her, she turned and said ""you have to wait"". I completely understand that but the way she said it was in a tone and look that I could only receive as annoyance. It was as if I was a nuisance to her. After reaching the back of the plane, I could hear loudly the other steward complaining and bad mouthing about a gentleman who wanted 2 diet cokes. I understand people talk shop but wow, in ear shot of other guests? We only received our purchases after the plane started to descend and before we knew it, we were forced to give up our purchased wine and cocktail. When my companion said ""I didn't even get to finish. I'm going to get a refund."" The steward retort with a ""you do that"". All I could think, and pardon the language, was ""what the heck?"". I have worked in customer service for over a decade, and this is by far the most unprofessional group of employees I have ever encountered. They were rude, unpleasant and just seemed so unhappy.

Thank you Virgin America, this worked out perfectly. Re ticketed in minutes, despite traveling on two different records. Given seats together in Main Cabin Select. Boarding was underway when we got to the gate, so we just walked right on board. We checked our bags, so no issue with lack of overhead space upon boarding. Left a few minutes late, then a 30 min ground hold, again due to SFO air traffic. Once in the air, choice of free food and beverages on this short 1 hr flight. Choose the protein snack with cheese and crackers and deli meats, which was excellent and would have not had a problem paying the $8 price tag, if we were in regular coach. I love the order online at our seat option. When the flight attendants get to your row, they simply hand you your choices. Very efficient. Landed 1 hr late in SFO, but still plenty of time for our connection. Spent 1.5 hrs in the Admirals Club, then a 3 hr flight to AUS, with again satisfying food options and beverages with a good choice of movies and shows to make the 3 hr flight time pass quickly. Would have liked to see a sandwich or salad offering on this sector, as the menu was the same as the short flight to SFO. Arrived on time, our bags were the 2nd ones off due to Priority Tags due to our status. Over all still a great airline that will be missed.

In the end, the flight was 2.5 hours late into Austin. There was no issue with weather; it is still unclear why we had such a delay. Virgin did a very poor job of explaining it and really provided no information about the delay until after our flight was to have departed.  Once we pushed back from the gate, it took about 1 hour before we took off. Then, about 20 minutes after take-off, some people started to get up to use the rest room. They were quickly scolded since the fasten seat belt sign was still on. Once the pilot finally turned off the sign, about a dozen people jumped out of their seats and formed a long line for the restrooms at the back of the plane. I waited a while, and once the rest room in the front was unoccupied for a couple of minutes, I went up and used it. I was in row 5, so very near the front. As I returned to my seat, the flight attended reminded me that the rest room in the front was for first class. I said I understood that but there was a long line in the back and they had already had us on the plane for a couple of hours, so I had to do what I had to do. She scolded me some more and made me promise that I would not use the first class restroom for the remainder of the flight. Then another person from row 4 went to use the front rest room. She refused to let him and insisted that he join the long line in the back. On other flights, we have been told that it is also against the rules to form a long line for the rest rooms. When the crew came through for drinks, they gave mostly ice and only about 2/3 of a cup of soda.

Checked in at the desk inside with nice agents. Priority boarding was nice. I had time to put stuff away and settle in before the rush of the remaining passengers. I had a drink prior to take off offered by professional and friendly staff. A great seat - I asked what the buttons were for on the armrest and it was for the seat massager. I used that all the way to Vegas (it put me to sleep pretty good twice). The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the food. I don't know why they had to get ""super fancy"" with it.

Even the headrest was high enough (which did not happen to me yet and I am a frequent flyer). Neither Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and others had this comfort. The entertainment system offered everything you wanted. Movies, music, games, food and drink orders. In general, the plane seemed very modern. When ordering a gin tonic (the 50ml gin bottle was told to cost 8$, which is a regular price for short haul flights) they offered me 2 for 1 bottles. Soda was free. As I bought my ticket via Skypicker and had a connection flight, I cannot tell how much the single flight was which makes it difficult to state anything about value for money. Ground service was very solid and friendly, no complaints. Cabin staff could have been a little bit more friendly. When I was asking for an emergency exit seat (one emergency exit row was kept empty as any passenger could upgrade their seat for $150, which I think is a lot, especially having that great seat comfort, which I did not know at that time), the cabin staff was not overly friendly, however, they have not been rude at any time.

Boarding went quickly too, and when we got on the plane, the cabin was lit up in deep purples and blues. I found that the entertainment was not quite as impressive as JetBlue's, but it was still good. The food selection could also have more variety. But those were not big problems, because the Gulfstream shortens the flight by an hour and were in Boston in 5.5 hours.

VivaAerobús,1,"""VivaAerobus flight was cancelled""","I purchased 2 tickets in Feb 2020 with VivaAerobús one for myself and the other for my hubby from March 23 through March 28. In March 2020, the COVID-19, pandemic was in full swing and by the time March 16, 2020 came around, our government made the call of having each individual state make decisions on closing down non-essential businesses. On top of this, there was a strict travel advisory concerning certain countries. I watched the news night and day trying to figure out if I should go because I also knew my bone graft procedure required a 5 to 6 month healing timeframe. I called my dental office in Cancun several times inquiring if there was any news from their administrators, I also watched news pertaining to Cancun, read news articles from Cancun and read numerous travel advisories from the US Dept of State concerning Cancun / Mexico. I was told that everything was a go by my dentist. I also kept calling my dental office, my hotel and finally VivaAerobus 1 week prior to departure to inquired what would occur if I should cancel due to the pandemic or if there had been any changes due to the pandemic that I need to be aware of. But Vivaaerobus customer service agents told me that my flight on March 23, 2020 had not been cancelled nor do they see of any future changes or cancellations for both my inbound or outbound flights. All 3 Vivaaerobus CSR agents who I spoke to prior to my departure on 3 different occasions each said the same thing including that “I would lose both of my airline fares for myself and my hubby and that I would not get a refund because it was a non refundable ticket. I explained to them that I did not want to get “stuck” in another country of course even if it’s Mexico but I was advised by these 3 CSR agents, that if my flight becomes delayed or cancelled, I could log onto the Vivaaerobus App and the updates would be there or that I could call the 1-800 number for Vivaaerobus and reach a CSR agent for further assistance if that occurred. I felt I had no choice and I didn’t want to lose our hard earned money so on March 23, 2020, my hubby & I went off on our trip. We had the Vivaaerobus App installed on both of our cell phones and we were able to check in and obtain our boarding pass 24 hours before our flight departed from Charlotte, NC. We were both hoping that after we got to the airport, that our flight would be cancelled so we could request a refund but it was not cancelled. The arrival/ departure screens at Charlotte Douglas Airport showed that our flight to Cancun was still scheduled and on time. We didn’t have any luggage to check on our flight only had 2 carry-ons. We made it to our gate 2 hours ahead of our 8:00 am flight and our plane was already parked at the gate. There was only 1 other passenger waiting for the flight. We boarded our outbound flight late, landed in Cancun safety. I concluded my dental appointment, constantly checked my VivaAerobus App for notifications none were provided by this airline. 10 hours before check in on March 27, 2020, the VivaAerobus App would not allow us to check in nor obtain our boarding passes. It showed an message which stated that we had to check in 2 hours before departure. We called and the 1-800 number but It was constantly busy, we sent emails/ inquiries through online chat to VivaAerobus but got NO RESPONSE. We decided to purchase a ticket with another airline.

Then we were charged $70 baggage, on top of the $140 we had already paid for baggage. On the return flight, they charged us $120 for carry-on's that were not charged on the departure flight, these carry-ons were a backpack and a purse. How can a backpack and a purse not be considered a free carry-on? There was no sizer or weight scale on the return trip, the ticket agent was just plain rude and said if we didn't pay for the carry-on's we could leave them in the airport! Tried dealing with customer service when we returned home for a refund of this nonsensical carry-on charge and it's just dealing with one incompetent after another. They did no investigation, just said whatever their ticket agents say, goes. Another issue that we witnessed on the flight home was that of another customer. In mid air a rude flight attendant grabbed a woman's coat from the overhead so harshly that she ripped the woman's coat, leaving a large tear.

WOW air,1,"""fly a more reliable airline""","We had booked the Wowair stopover Detroit to Barcelona via Keflavik and just shy of 2 weeks prior to our vacation (family of 5), we received a text and email from Wowair saying they had cancelled our BCN stopover. Because we had already scheduled time off work and school and hotels, cars, meeting others in Barcelona, we were forced to buy connections on Air France. WOW said they could get us as Paris so we had to purchase 5 round air tickets from CDG to BCN, lost 2 days of our vacation, lost a night in a hotel in BCN, had to pay for a hotel at CDG, spent almost 2 full days dealing with connections, layovers (extra costs for food, car etc) Then several days before our DTW to KEF flight, WOW air changed our airplane and scattered us all over the airplane (kids in middle seats in back etc). We were one of the first to book on the flight (Was empty at time) and had paid to purchase upgraded seats together/seats together. Wow did not honor seat assignments. spent close to 2 days on phone / email / twitter support with Wowair and AirFrance and hotels/car rental scheduling, rescheduling, getting seat assignments, seeking compensation. Wow cites an EU regulation that if cancel 2 weeks before, will offer no compensation; they slipped in just before 2 week window with cancelled flights. The staff was very nice but the company is just horrible. We were out approximately $2000 all in and no compensation or accommodation from company. Very sad because this was a long planned family trip that we had saved for and planned for a long time. The day we were flying, the company was offering ""free flights to people with the last name Valentine"". Very gimmicky and not taking care of their paying customers. Lastly, truly the most uncomfortable flight we have ever been on. It is a discount airline but so this is to be expected (though not at all discount when they screw you and cancel your flight). The economy / no upgrade seats are the most uncomfortable you could imagine, people were very miserable. Many families, could not move around at all. The first three rows were very large, like the people could do a pike/legs straight out. Makes no sense to give the upgraded seats too much room while the other 30 rows really suffered. The flights were packed and a lot of unhappy people. They charge for even water so the by the time you pay for water, food, definitely consider an upgrade, charges for luggage and if you are really unlucky - cancellation fees - you could fly first class with a reputable airline. Iceland is lovely but fly Delta or United or partners or anyone but Wowair. I read many many complaints on the internet etc. that they did this same behavior to many many other people.

Most airlines that I fly with offer you a lateral alternative so that some indemnity is given to the customer. Not in this case. WOW air only presents customers with two offers: to cancel for a full refund or to cancel and receive a gift certificate worth the cost of your trip and an additional 25%. Although this seems like a nice offer, the tickets to fly out of Boston or New York (as they have cancelled all of the flights from Pittsburgh) are twice the price of what we originally paid. I think WOW air is betting on the fact that customers will have made reservations and would be hesitant to cancel. What a racket. My best advice would be to never book with this company as you will waste time and money in the end.

WOW air,1,"""I give them a poor rating""","We were scheduled to fly from Newark to Reykjavík and then from there to Dublin on WOW Air. As many know this company is low budget and a cheap way to get to Iceland and some major cities in Europe. We paid for upgrades seats so we weren’t cramped and also got the fare that included a carry on and a checked bag. While we were in the front of the plane if you don’t buy priority boarding passes it’s basically a free for all to board. At that point we sat on the plane and waited for two hours until they tried to figure out what was wrong with a “sensor” on the plane. They deplaned us after two hours. We sat in the terminal for another hour. After that. We waited and it was becoming clearer that we would not make our connecting flight to Dublin. No one on the ground knew the results and what would happen when we got to Iceland and with limited flights out of that airport the choice was do we wait out WOW or get on another flight in Newark on another airline at our cost. So ultimately WOW canceled our flight. As I was on the phone waiting on the phone I got a flight on Aer Lingus direct to Dublin and since WOW canceled our first flight they gave me the option. To cancel the whole round trip flight for my whole family. Which I did. They also said that they would credit me the money for our hotel to stay in Newark for a flight the next day. So I have to submit that claim later today. While I am paying more for my flight to Dublin now I’m not out the money to WOW as I have an e-mail confirmation of the flight cancellation and refund amount. So if they try to not refund me I can dispute the charges to my card. Some other notes the customer service people on the 800 number knew the flight was canceled before the people at the checkin desk. They also sorted me on to another plane 2 days later which would have really screwed me up for the trip. The day delay was not a super big deal. Also with limited options to Iceland I’d be careful booking tours in Iceland before you arrive. Folks were flying to Iceland and had these expensive tours booked and they were going to be out tons of money. While ultimately WOW made it right and I’ll get my money back I would not recommend them at all. However, with limited choices to Iceland if you must fly them to get there wait or give yourself an extra 24 hours before booking those expensive tours that might not refund you the money if you don’t get there. If you are just stopping over and connecting in Iceland to another destination with WOW Air pay more and get on one of the larger carriers. They have larger fleets to add flights and put you on other planes. The person at the WOW desk also was very clear that they have no relationships with other airlines. They won’t be able to get you on another flight out of your airport unless it’s a WOW flight.

No reason was shared, no real info, it was just delayed by about 2 hours but the flight crew announced over the speaker on the plane. “They will hold your connections for you and we will make up time in the air”. Well that was a lie, don’t announce things that aren’t true.

I flew from DTW to CPH via KEF, I found the ground staff, cabin crew and all other contact personnel very efficient, approachable and polite. Both aircraft I flew with were modern A-321s. While the seats were not the most comfortable, and in the basic seat the legroom was fairly tight they did recline a little and there were power sockets/USD points at each seat.

WOW air,1,"""upset with our experience""","Chicago to Paris via Reykjavík. My husband and I flew this airline for our honeymoon to Paris. To say we were unimpressed would be an understatement. First off, I was unable to add any baggage to my reservation to fly out of Chicago to Paris, because of this we were charged almost $300 at the airport because we were not even allowed a carry on bag. We travel often and this is not the case with any other airline we have used. If we would have known this we would have packed accordingly. There is not much you can do about this besides pay the money when you are at the airport. Then we find out there is not free in flight entertainment, like the other airlines we have flown overseas. Also, the seats were so crammed together my husbands knees were hitting the seat in front of us the whole time. He could not even put his tray down if he wanted to because of this. Why didn't we pay for extra leg room you ask? Well because we have not had this problem on any other flight we have flown. Then on the way back from Paris I was able to add luggage to our reservation but again, like most airlines, we expected the weight limit to be 23kg per bag. No. It was only 20kg so we had to pull things out of our suitcase to get the weight down. Additionally,the lady checking us in was very rude and was talking about us in French with a very unpleasant look on her face. I am not fluent in French but body language says more than words. The check in attendant also first said that it would cost 10$ per kg over 20 and then after we took some things out she said it was 15$ because we needed to go to Chicago. Well of coarse we needed our bags to go all the way home. I also would  point out that whether our bags were under the plane or in the cabin, there is still the same amount of weight on the plane. Making us open all our luggage to save money in the airport is ridiculous. We were already frustrated and her changing information and being very rude and unprofessional did not help matters. We ended up paying $400 to get our luggage back on top of the $300 that we payed on the way there. This is the price of an extra airline ticket. This being said, we could have flown with ANY other airline and not have dealt with all the inconveniences. We are very upset with our flight experience on this trip.

WOW air,1,"""a huge risk flying this airline""","Los Angeles to Reykjavik. The only reason I considered this airline is because it was the only direct flight and they had ""big seats,"" that we could upgrade to so I thought why not. We paid a lot extra to get the biggest seats, plus bags, meals etc. Well, the night before the flight, we check in and they have put us in standard seats with no extra legroom. They have four types of seats and they put us in the very smallest despite us paying several hundred dollars more per ticket for bigger seats. So, I call the customer service line and they just tell me that I will have to file a claim when I get back! So, my husband calls and they move our seats to what they say are bigger seats. Guess what? They were standard seats on the seat map. So, at that gate they start selling our seats that we already paid for as upgrades! So, my husband goes up and tries to find out why they are selling seats we already paid for and they just offer him some other seats that are supposedly XL but they are in the back of the plane. He says, we don't want seats that don't recline. They say they do recline. So, he agrees and they try to charge him again for an upgrade! Guess what? They are regular standard seats and they don't recline and for extra good measure the plug between the seats doesn't work on either row of seats that they put us in. This was on an overnight flight with my 8-year-old daughter. So, it comes to our return flight - same scenario. They put us in regular standard seats. We called the night before and my husband paid for another upgrade even though we already purchased their highest tier because he doesn't want to argue with them, we just wanted better seats. So, they move our seats, but when we get to the airport, they put us back in the regular standard seats! So, we spent the entire 3 hours at the airport trying to get better seats by talking to 3 different service desks, to no avail. We tell the crew when we get on the plane in case they have any extra decent seats and they offer us one free water. Plugs don't work on this flight either. Every single person we dealt with told us our seats were XL until I showed them the seat map and they will charge you for upgrades in seats that aren't upgrades at all. Everyone just said you'll have to file a claim. Guess what. When I filed a claim when we got back, they declined it and said that we had to contact customer service. Customer Service claimed that they don't deal with refunds. His message told me that I would have to go through an airline rights group. So, they basically tried to steal our money and make it as difficult as possible to get some of our money back. We never got our meals that we paid for or our seats. You are taking a huge risk flying this airline because even if they cancel your flight, you might not get your money back based on their customer service practices of denying legitimate claims.

WOW air,1,"""bumped down two classes""","Saint Louis to Reykjavik. Being the first to book WOW Premium on our travel dates, we did not expect three family members to be bumped down two classes of service – from Premium to Basic – and the other two members to be bumped from Premium to Plus. But, that’s what happened two days before departure. How do I know we booked first? Because the seat schematic in premium class was completely empty when we bought tickets 8 months before departure and selected our seats. Plane change was given as the reason, but the real reason was that WOW reconfigured their seats and classes of service, and didn’t notify anyone – at least not us. So instead of re-assigning seats according to booking dates or giving you the option of selecting new seats based on an early-booking priority, we were evidently randomly selected to downgrade even though we would have re-booked different dates had we been given more than 48-hours’ notice. The same thing happened on the way home. We were again bumped to lower service levels. On the way to Iceland, we at least received a few of the Premium perks, including a “meal” that consisted of a 10-inch baguette with two deli-thin slices of ham. But, this time, we were asked to show our receipts to the flight attendants in order to receive the meal and two drinks – one hot and one cold. Yes, that’s right, one hot and one cold. And we were informed that if we wanted two cold drinks we would have to pay for one, even if we were to forego the hot drink. Our luggage arrived with us on the flight to Iceland. It also made it home, which we were happy to discover after a suspenseful, 40-minute wait at St. Louis’ baggage claim. Others weren’t so lucky. At least a half-dozen passengers mentioned that their luggage had been lost. Some on a non-stop flight; others on a connection through Reykjavik to and from Europe. One individual was on his way home after two weeks in Europe; he still hadn’t received his suitcase. Another person mentioned that her luggage never made it onboard the non-stop flight to Iceland. Then, when it did arrive, WOW refused to deliver the bags. They kept them at the airport until her week-long tour returned for the trip back to the States. Fly WOW if cost-savings are paramount and you’re willing to chance the service for the savings. Seats are really small, unless you upgrade.

Xiamen Airlines,2,"""they are a 3rd rate airline""","Seattle to Manila via Xiamen. My wife and I planned a trip to the Philippines from Seattle and decided upon Xiamen Airlines Business Class. The routing was Seattle, Shenzen, Xiamen and Manila. We traveled late October 2018. The seating configuration in the Boeing 787, Business Class was 2-2-2. The seats were lay flat for sleeping, but unfortunately were leatherette covered which meant one would slide forward when seated upright due to the slippery covering. Lunch was served and I chose duck. This was the consistency of rubber and virtually inedible. The 12.5 hour flight was uneventful, however during this time the cabin staff barely checked on us. When they did, there was a distinct language problem. We couldn't understand them and they couldn't understand us! One would think when one is on a international flight a common understandable language should be used. When we arrived at Shenzen we had a layover of 2 hours during which time we had to clear Chinese Customs and Immigration. After this we had to wait in a departure lounge without being told anything about our next flight leg. There were about 12 onward passengers waiting for the next leg. Eventually we were told our boarding gate and ETD. The flight to Xiamen was around 1 hour. After arrival we had to pick up our luggage and we went to the Xiamen Airlines counter to get a hotel voucher as we had 20 hour layover. Xiamen Airlines to not have a hotel bus or any means to transport us to the hotel. We had to change money to get a taxi. This was an effort in its own right. We did leave some of our baggage at the left luggage office at the airport, which helped. The next day we caught a taxi back to the airport. We go through security on entry to the airport before checking in for our flight to Manila. I should mention that boarding to Manila like the short leg for Shenzen was chaos. No boarding by class or seating, just go for it! Service on board was almost like a domestic flight, again a language problem. We arrive in Manila after almost 36 hours after leaving Seattle. It was nice to experience the friendliness of Philippine Customs and Immigration.

We were again routed via Shenzen and had to go through immigration and carry ALL bags through security. The flight back was slightly better, but there was still the language barrier.

Found this airline to be just as professional, efficient, and friendly to fly with. Our flight did have to go thru 2 Chinese ports of entry (Qingdao & Xiamen). The flight was very comfortable due to the new airplane (Boeing 787-9). I noticed the increased air pressure (6000 ft elevation) and increased humidity did not dry me out and felt good at the end of 14 hours in flight. The flight staff was very courteous, attentive, and tried their best with English but Google translate came in handy to communicate. Wifi was available but not very good - too many people using it and not enough bandwidth for streaming. Food was good - 2 hot meals and 2 cold snacks in-between kept you full and satisfied. Very Chinese cuisines on all 4 legs of the flight (2 international, 2 domestic). Just remember, the airline is Chinese and therefore will serve Chinese food - don't expect Panda Express type food like the US. The food is primarily pork based with some fish, chicken or beef offering. If you elect vegetarian or muslim or any other special needs food, make sure you request this 24 hours before your flight. I saw some western folks unhappy with seeing unfamiliar Chinese food being served on a Chinese airline - I had to chuckle watching them eat the bread and desert for their meals. The only issue which is not the airline's fault was going thru Chinese immigration. We did not have a Chinese visa which is normally required for landing in China, but 50+ countries can ""transit"" thru China if you can prove your final destination is outside of China. The government issues a temporary transit visa for those that are going thru the country - it's good for 24 hours. At our 2 hr layover for refueling, Qingdao was the worst - they scrutinized and held up the entire non Chinese group of passengers looking for errors & past problems. They pulled 2 passengers out of the group for failing to register with a local Chinese police agency the last time they were in China. Military uniformed people surrounded them making you feel like you are in a communist country.... The airline staff was very good at preparing you for Chinese immigration - having your itinerary with you, boarding pass with correct name spelled, etc. Landing at Xiamen was much easier and nicer immigration folks. We even had time to visit the First class airport lounge using our Amex Plat card. Return trip was good and we even had an overnight layover and the airline provided a hotel for the night at no cost which was nice. We did have to pay the taxi rides both ways so remember to bring some Chinese Yuan (RMB) currency. We got to also go on a tour of the city on a double decker sightseeing bus that took us all around the perimeter of the island.

You have to wait for your flight .",Family Leisure,Economy Class,12/1/2017,Dissatisfied,Very Satisfied,Neutral,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Los Angeles,Manila,TRUE,Philippines,FALSE,International
Xiamen Airlines,1,"""I missed my flight""","Los Angeles to Manila via Xiamen. I missed my flight due to confusing schedule (12:15am), I went to the airport 3 hours within the same day (unfortunately I was told by the lady at the airline counter that I was late to my flight! And it was supposed to be there the earliest day or before midnight of that day!!). Instead of helping me by providing assistance, I was told to buy a new ticket or ""Go home!"" I tried to talk to them but nobody helped me at all and they did not give me a chance to get the ticket rebooked/rescheduled, not even try to refund my ticket nor provided a discount for my new ticket. I will not recommend Xiamen Airline at all.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,11/1/2017,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Los Angeles,Manila,TRUE,Philippines,FALSE,International
Xiamen Airlines,6,"""worst part was the layover in Xiamen""","Los Angeles to Bangkok via Xiamen. It was not the overly-friendly skies, especially on the shorter flight, but the snacks, food and beverage were OK. Another review reminded me of the barely audible English announcements (use headphones to hear it). The seats and legroom seem average. The Boeing 787 for the LAX-XMN segment is a nice, new aircraft. The entertainment system had a small selection of music and movies, which were adequate. Emirates scores better there! The website is hard to use, and changes seemed impossible. But I successfully purchased a ticket. If I purchased again, I would be certain everything is perfect before clicking Submit. I'm hesitant to call ""customer service"" as English is not their main language, and rules over customer satisfaction seem to be the situation. The worst part of the flight was the layover in Xiamen, China. Border control entry is required, followed by departure control. This is slow and time consuming. Re-entering security is very strict. Every passenger is wanded after passing the magnetometers. My baggage scan revealed two small Bic lighters, which were confiscated. Any lithium batteries in checked bags are likely to be removed. The airport is years behind many International airports, and is hard to spend time in. However, long layovers can qualify you for a hotel room (+5 hours), a city tour, or the lounge on the lowest level - with free Wi-Fi. The lounge was quite basic and drab. Hard to call it a ""benefit"". A room in the back had cots. In the airport, I was twice offered working iPhones for cash. With a landing announcement that mentions contacting quarantine if you're ill, including headaches, nausea or diarrhea, and the scrutiny upon entry and exit, I don't advise buying black market iPhones. The ticket price was very competitive. If they improved the layover experience at their airport in Xiamen, it might be worth the savings.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,11/1/2017,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Dissatisfied,Neutral,Dissatisfied,Los Angeles,Bangkok,TRUE,Thailand,FALSE,International
Xiamen Airlines,9,"""Boeing 787-8 was new""","Seattle to Shenzhen. Check-In was quick. Boarding commenced slightly late but was controlled and orderly. The Boeing 787-8 was new and a bit squeaky. The seat had a 17 inch width and 32-33 inches of pitch. The seat had a cup holder, remote, USB and AC power ports and a fairly large personal screen. The selection of content was decent but a lack of Western movies and appealing Eastern movies could be improved. The food served was good and a decent portion was served. The crew were quite sincere and attentive to all calls, Their English was okay for interactions but not too great over the PA.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,7/1/2017,Very Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Very Satisfied,Satisfied,Dissatisfied,Seattle,Shenzhen,TRUE,China,FALSE,International
Xiamen Airlines,7,"""English skill needs improvement""","Los Angeles to Xiamen. The flight was delayed due to unknown reason.  The aircraft is relatively new, bright, clean and modern. The interior was specially decorated for this inauguration flight with LAX symbols. The crews welcomed us with big smiles and everyone gets a little gift for the inauguration flight. They personal entertainment system has a large screen, and the system worked just as I wanted without struggle. A safety card, two magazines and a menu in the pocket; a blanket and a bottle of water on the seat. But the menu missed a translation for breakfast. The food is not bad but can be improved. The crew were trying to act as friendly, but lacked some sincereness, but they did a great job. Their English skill really needs improvement.  As a Chinese airline they followed the CAAC rule, which restricted people to use their laptops and other devices only when the aircraft reached cruising attitude and didn't allow passengers to switch on their phones at all. And they locked the 787 windows to a certain brightness which make them impossible to adjust by passengers. Another problem is that I had a transfer flight at XMN, but I had to pick up my luggage and recheck it again.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,6/1/2017,Neutral,Satisfied,Neutral,Neutral,Satisfied,Very Dissatisfied,Los Angeles,Xiamen,TRUE,China,FALSE,International
Xiamen Airlines,8,"""Super cheap tickets""","Seattle to Tokyo via Shenzhen & Xiamen. Super cheap tickets, lack of information before and during trip, some airport confusion if you're really out of it or don't speak Chinese. They provide a hotel if flying all legs of trip on Xiamen Airlines with overnight layover, entertainment and food caters to Chinese tastes. I speak Mandarin, so I rate this flight a 8/10. Screaming deal of a ticket booked in 12/2016. Super nervous after receiving email in January 2017 of seat cancellation for the first leg of my trip (Seattle-Shenzhen). Customer service doesn't speak English. Got a call back in Chinese (my Chinese is ok, but not my first language) and took about 30 minutes plus another 30 minute call back to realize that the seat No I requested was cancelled and not the seat on the flight.  Over next few months, received a few more e-mails stating that flight times had changed, even though they were the same as when we booked them. Still felt insecure about whether or not our trip would really happen.  No online check-in for foreigners. We show up at the airport and have an easy check-in. Heard that Xiamen Air provides a hotel which the airport staff confirmed.  Arrived at Shenzhen to some chaos - they separate the transfers passengers, people are confused as to where to go, but are shepherded by the Xiamen air staff. Waited about 45 minutes with several other foreigners to get my boyfriend's 24-hour transit visa which allows him to leave the airport. Disembarked at Xiamen, shepherded again by the staff to pick up our baggage. Many of the foreign passengers did not know about the hotel that Xiamen air provided us with, since we all arrived around 9pm and had connecting flights in the morning. They expected to sleep on the floor of the airport. Followed signs to the reception desk that makes lodging arrangements. Showed our passports and tickets and provided with a room at the E-Charm Hotel in Xiamen. If you are travelling alone, they will pair you with someone of the same gender. The hotel is about 10 minutes away from the airport and costs about 15 RMB one way. Although the room provided was free, we had to cover our travel expense both ways to and from the hotel. I think this is strange. If you are only going to and from the hotel, the cash machines up on level 2 allow you to take out 100 RMB. Hotel was nice for Chinese standards! Continued to Tokyo in the morning. Flights were all around ok - seats were good enough, entertainment and meals were Chinese oriented - we ordered vegetarian meals. They were stingy on the drinks and don't add ice unless you ask. Warm beers on international flights, but grab them early.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,5/1/2017,Satisfied,Satisfied,Dissatisfied,Neutral,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Seattle,Tokyo,TRUE,Japan,FALSE,International
Xiamen Airlines,1,"""not book a flight on this airline""","My wife and I booked a flight for May 2017 from Portland to Shenzhen via Seattle. After 2 months, Xiamen notified us that our flight from Seattle to Shenzhen had been cancelled. We had to re-book our flight with Delta at a higher price $686.00 per ticket on Xiamen vs. $891.00 per ticket on Delta or $205.00 more per ticket. Furthermore, our new flight only takes us to Hong Kong, which will cost us more even more money with van transfers and taxis. I would recommend that you not book a flight on this airline, as they are not reliable and will leave you stranded.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,4/1/2017,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Very Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Dissatisfied,Seattle,Shenzhen,TRUE,China,FALSE,International
